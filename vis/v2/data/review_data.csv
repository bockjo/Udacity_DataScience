3,A2QMQJ41G3JJOU,B00BGO0Q9O,A. Benson,1405123200,"Early on, I noticed it wasn't accurate.  I was using a pedometer before so I knew how long my walk was.  What I found was that Dashboard showed one value and details showed another.  I think that was an app issue.  I also noticed inconsistencies in the sleep chart.  I changed the sleep range and the time of restlessness and awake changes.  How is that possible.  I was awake at 3am and then it moved to 2:50 am.  It seemed to work well enough so I kept using it.  Suddenly it died.  I am pretty sure I had just charged it and it was saying dead.  I plugged it in and it wouldn't charge.  I googled it and the fitbit site advised that I use a toothpick to clear debris from the contacts.  That didn't work.  The site said to try rubbing alcohol.  I used my finger to apply it.  I plugged it in and a light came on but wouldn't stay lit.  If I pushed it into the charger it would light up.  I was about to wedge it in there with the toothpick when it stayed lit.  It fully charged.  I wore it for a walk and during the walk it buzzed to say I had reached 10k.  I had not.  I synced when I got home and at first it said over 11k and then everything reset to zero.

4,A337MH4DW79U1N,B00BGO0Q9O,A. Cole,1404950400,"I rarely give one star reviews on any website, but this product deserves it. I like the concept of the product, and the website is easy to use. They're not 100% accurate, but the food and sleep tracking features are also great. The device doesn't count all your steps sometimes, but I've found when I put the tracker in my shoe while on the treadmill, it's very accurate.However, Fitbit's customer service is horrendous.I had a syncing issue with my device, and it was syncing intermittently but not when I was prompting it to sync. At the time I was using it as my main alarm clock, but I wasn't waking up at the same time each morning and needed to change the alarm nightly before going to sleep.I emailed them after following the steps in the help section of their website. I'm the type of person that does all the suggested fixes, and searches for answers online before contacting customer care.When you file a help ticket, their website instructs you to fill out a form with details like your issue, the type of computer you're using, and your device, etc.The person who answered my query sent me instruction for a PC and told me to check if I was behind a firewall. When I pointed out that I was a Mac user (as per the form they made me fill out), they replied politely, but still didn't give me a useable suggestion...because they took so long to reply that the Fitbit started to sync again by itself. They basically replied that a sync happened at X time, and I should let them know if it still wouldn't sync and if I needed further assistance.I mentioned in my help ticket that my device was having syncing issue all of that week...it's as if they completely disregarded all the information I sent in, and they were answering the parts they deemed fit.My next issue is the bands. I've bought 2 replacement bands since I've had my device, the first replacement within 2 months, and second within another 2 months...2 replacement bands in 4 months suggest the quality of the bands are poor. I've had watches last me for years, and I have a bracelet on my dominant hand that I've worn without problems for the past 5 years. I think I can take care of items meant to be worn on my hand...especially a device I wear on my non-dominant hand, that I do not shower with (even though it says you can shower with it on).Now, I only use the device to measure my steps when I workout, and occasionally as an alarm or to measure my sleep. Funny, but my calorie burn estimate is higher now even though I don't wear the band for half the day (which means it's laying still for hours).",1,10.07.2014,Do not waste your money,"Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black",92.85,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21ukcP7LNVL._SX300_.jpg,Fitbit,,36,wear work shower water,www.amazon.com/gp/profile/A337MH4DW79U1N,0.081884058,0.435507246,474

9,A24J5BKWHKD9OR,B00BGO0Q9O,A. K.,1405296000,"I bought my first Fitbit last year after trying the Nike Fuelband for about a year. I'll do a comparison of the two for those that are considering one or the other:Build: The Fitbit is a little smaller than the Nike and, at least for me, this is a good thing. The fitting system is a bit more granular, with multiple holes available for all wrist-sizes, as opposed to the Nike which, essentially, gave you 2 choices for whichever band size you happened to order. I'm using the larger black wristband, and it fits perfectly (snug-but-not-too-snug). It doesn't jiggle around when I move (unlike my Nike).Ease of charging: The Nike wins out here, since I could just take it off my wrist and plug into any available USB port, whereas the Fitbit requires you to take the small electronic sensor out of the wristband, insert it into the special adapter provided with the wristband, and then plug into a USB port. I've had one or two issues with plugging into a 2.1A USB port as opposed to a 1A, but generally it charges fine.Ease of syncing: The Fitbit syncs via a USB dongle that plugs into your computer or by Bluetooth to your mobile device (I'm using a Moto X on Android 4.4.3). The dongle seems a little extraneous, but I have one constantly plugged into my home Mac Mini and one in my Macbook Air, so I rarely have reason to turn BT on to sync with my phone or iPad. Syncing occurs pretty quickly and painlessly. The Nike, from what I remember, was also relatively painless, but ONLY could sync with a mobile device unless plugged into the USB port. So, while the Fitbit does inexplicably require a dongle, this dongle makes syncing much more painless.Everyday use: I am a pretty sweaty guy, but neither the Fitbit nor the Nike had any real long-term issues with cleanliness on a daily basis. I wore both in the shower, and this (combined with hand washing during the day) seemed to do the job of cleaning them both. The Nike did have more slots and grooves, and I do remember getting some sunscreen in there one day that was a pain to clean out. As mentioned, the better fit of the Fitbit meant that I didn't really notice it around my wrist as much as I did the Nike, which tended to jiggle around. The Fitbit is also a bit flatter, which meant it didn't really get in the way when typing on a computer or doing any other daily activities.Battery-use: Both started with excellent battery life. I routinely got up to 7 days with my Fitbit before needing a charge (similar with the Nike). However, both had gradual degradation in battery life. With the Fitbit, I actually had to get a replacement after 8 months of use since I could no longer get more than 16 hours or so out of one full charge, which meant I had to charge it every night. This also meant that I couldn't take advantage of the sleep-tracking function since it had to be charging.The Nike also lost charge duration over time, but it was slightly less abrupt and a little more gradual than the Fitbit. After about a year with the Nike, I went from 5-7 days/charge to 2-3.Overall:I'd probably recommend the Fitbit over the Nike, if only because it seems to be a little less intrusive in your life. There are many more differences between the two that I'm sure are outlined in other reviews, like intricacies in the software and which phones/mobile devices they can sync with, and I'm happy to answer questions, but these are the main differences which, for me, mean I'd probably choose the Fitbit if I had to choose again. Make sure you order from Amazon, or somewhere with similar great customer service, since I did have to replace it after 8 months, and that was relatively pain-free through Amazon.",4,14.07.2014,Fitbit vs Nike Fuelband - Deciding factors for me,"Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black",92.85,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21ukcP7LNVL._SX300_.jpg,Fitbit,,82,data use monitor information,www.amazon.com/gp/profile/A24J5BKWHKD9OR,0.185496977,0.486032376,663

18,A1CIWU7YVDYMUW,B00BGO0Q9O,Amanda Cross,1404345600,"The fitbit flex is great for tracking normal, everyday activity as long as you are moving forward...Positives: I love the bracelet look and feel because I don't think I could use a clip very effectively. The band is comfortable and fits well around my wrist. I haven't had an issue putting it on myself or having it fall off during use. You just need to make sure it's securely snapped. The charging has been simple and quick and the battery lasts about 4 days, the amount advertised. The app is pretty awesome. I am someone who likes to see immediate results and this definitely gives me that option.The tracking while outside walking or running does seem to be accurate and it makes it fun to try and beat your daily goal. I find myself making more of an effort to get up and move around more, which is exactly what I wanted from the fitbit flex.Negatives: The tracking on a treadmill or while on a stationary machine is non-existent. I typically run on a treadmill and not outside and the fitbit flex does not track any type of stationary movement, despite arm movement or steps taken. The 3D spatial tracking device needs forward movement to properly track your movement so a 3 mile run was tracked as a 1.2 mile run with about 2,000 steps. The way around this is to manually go back into the dashboard and add an activity and input the information about the activity tracked on the machine and the fitbit will make the changes. While this workout is sufficient to solve the problem, it does not seem to jive with the passive tracking nature of the device. I have also found that the app and the dashboard track calories differently. The dashboard will display the correct number of calories burned and the app seems to show more calories or &#34;projected calories&#34;. The difference isn't huge but when you are tracking your food as well, it makes it difficult to gauge the number of calories you have left to consume if you're just using the app. Also, if you just stand still and swing your arm in a walking motion, the fitbit will track steps, so it does seem very sensitive to that motion.Overall: This is a good device for someone who wants the motivation to get more active throughout the day and just wants an idea of how many calories they burn during a typical 24-hour period. If you're going to use it for running outside or walking, it is a great device to track your movements and get you up and moving. If you want to use it for stationary machines at the gym, I would recommend the fitbit one which clips on to your clothes. It tracks stationary movement more accurately and still gives you the motivation to get up and moving.",3,03.07.2014,Great for forward motion but don't stand still!,"Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black",92.85,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21ukcP7LNVL._SX300_.jpg,Fitbit,,172,activity-tracking running calories,www.amazon.com/gp/profile/A1CIWU7YVDYMUW,0.254206349,0.506254724,479

I was the only one who ordered mine from Amazon out of the 10 people in my family who have one, and mine failed after one month of use. It happened after doing the dishes, my tracker was non responsive and there was condensation inside of the top of the tracker where it says fitbit. Afterwards I finally got it to charge, but it would only last for 20 minutes but would not track any movement. I contacted Fitbit and conversed with them about the problem. After they concluded that it was not user error I sent them a screen shot of my order form from Amazon and they sent me a new one. Very helpful customer service. But it was still annoying since one of Fitbits main attractions is that it can get wet. I will see if this one holds up better.This is by far the best, and most comfortable tracker that I have had. I had the Nike tracker for a while but it was uncomfortable and not as stylish as the Fitbit, which fits perfectly around my wrist. Very accurate step counter as well as sleep tracker.

I have not had the problems with the wrist band coming undone that others have had. I have been using the product for over a month now and have lost weight. I think by far the best feature is being able to set a weight loss goal and have the app show me as my day progresses how many calories I have left for that day in order to achieve that goal. For example, if I have a super active day then I will have more calories to eat, but if I have a lazy day it adjusts my calories lower as the day goes on. This is so effective because it does not make sense to eat the same calories every day if one day you are a couch potato and the next you do not sit down for 12 hours.

36,A1XT3NOK54IWM2,B00BGO0Q9O,Amazon Customer,1404604800,"I've had my Fitbit Flex for 1 year and 3 months.  In that time I've actually had 6 Flexes which tells you a little about the quality of these devices.  My original Fitbit worked for 1 week and then died.  The stores were out of stock and Fitbit did replace it for me directly with no problems.  About 3 months after that the replacement stopped charging.  So Fitbit replaced that one.  Then after a month the band fell apart and Fitbit replaced that.  A few months later it stopped synching with my IPhone so Fitbit replaced it again.  A few more months and it started shutting off randomly and refusing to charge so they replaced it again.  That replacement didn't track steps accurately so they just sent me another replacement.  They also had to replace another wrist band for me when I bought a 3 pack of the replacements and one ripped after only 2 weeks of use.I'm not super hard on my Fitbits.  I take it off to shower and I mostly use it to track walking and some jogging.  They have been good about replacing the hardware as seen above.  However, I've talked to them several times about the accuracy of this wrist tracker and the fact that it's almost 100% accurate if I attach it to my shoe but only about 50% accurate on my wrist.  Their answer? Send a new Fitbit.  However, the problem persists.  It's clearly something that I'm doing that makes it be off but they won't even begin to address the issue.  I've tested many scenarios and sent them the data to show what's happening with no response other than getting yet another Fitbit.  My husband also has the Flex and has had the same one the entire time with no problems and his is accurate too.  If I wear his Fitbit I get the same inaccurate step count and he can wear mine and be accurate so the problem is clearly something I'm doing but it's frustrating that Fitbit won't give any assistance to figure this out.  I'm sure I'm not the only one who has this problem.I do like the Fitbit app and the recent updates to include GPS tracking of activities is very nice.  However, it won't yet track cycling which would be a huge benefit to me.  Also, they've changed the way they track &#34;Active Minutes&#34; so if you're a walker don't plan to ever meet this goal.  I walked 3 miles with my dog today in 39 minutes and the Fitbit didn't count any of that as active time.  It now only counts jogging/running as actual active minutes so if you want this for motivation just to get moving it may not be the best choice.  It sounds petty but it really does annoy me that walking is no longer counted as &#34;Active Minutes&#34; when the FDA counts it and it's certainly better than being a couch potato.  After knee surgery I simply can't run like I used to and feel like they're losing some customer base with this new algorithm.  It would be better if they tracked &#34;Active Minutes&#34; and &#34;Very Active Minute&#34; to satisfy both runners and walkers alike.Bottom line, this device will either work for you accurately or not.  There's no way to tell for sure and you'll either get a Fitbit that goes the distance or you'll get the lemons that have to be replaced constantly.  Overall, the idea is great, the app is good, replacements have been easy but it's been a hassle to have this many in a year.

The band itself is very comfortable and after about month, I didn't even notice it on my wrist.  The tracking of my steps seems to be fairly accurate.  The only time I have noticed an inaccuracy is when I am using tools or other machinery that might cause the motion sensors to be triggered when I am really not moving.  For example while driving on a dirt washboard road, the flex picked up all the vibration in the wheel and thought I had just run 5,000 steps.  Things like that can be of a hassle, but for the most part, the flex is accurate.  The ability to track sleep is also a great feature.  Simple to turn on, simply tap the band five times quickly and it sets the mode to sleep.  Again, the band is really unnoticeable and comfortable to wear, so sleeping with it on is no big deal.The one word of caution I would mention is that the latch that holds the band on the wrist can come loose and allow the band to fall off if hit just right.  I play basketball and on several occasions have had the band fall off after being hit on the wrist.

54,A3GDFJ24G60FD3,B00BGO0Q9O,Angela Rosenbrock,1403568000,"I bought my Fitbit Flex in February after seeing information about it in several magazines. It is comfortable enough to wear constantly.  I am on my second small black band because the first one stretched out and started to tear.  I also bought the 3 pack of colored bands and have been switching bands to match my outfit.  Inserting and removing the tracker is easy although sometimes it has been difficult to get the clasp lined up with the holes in the band. My battery lasts for approximately a week.  I recharge on Wednesdays when I am sitting at my desk in my office.I am a data junkie so I love the fact that I have a constant stream of data about my activities. I find that I have an almost compulsive need to get my step count in on a daily basis.  I also pay a lot of attention to my water intake.Recently I also bought an Aria scale and I like the way it syncs with my dashboard on the Fitbit website.  It provides a lot of good information although I question it's accuracy at times (that's a whole separate review).The sleep tracking function has really opened my eyes to the fact that I don't get enough sleep.  The sleep I do get is pretty good quality according to the tracker. The alarm function works well for me during the week.  I don't think I have ever slept through it.  I have slept through it on the weekends however, especially when I am really tired.  I would say that if you are a heavy sleeper there is a good chance you won't wake up to it.The calories in/out function is probably my least favorite.  I have synced my Fitbit account with My Fitness Pal but the Fitbit website doesn't allow for much customization as far as recommended calorie intake.  I also synced my Run Double Couch to 5K app so my calories and steps are automatically added to both My Fitness Pal and my Fitbit dashboard.Fitbit does lack a few things that I would like to have.  It does not have any kind of heart monitor.  This would be very helpful during exercise.  It also doesn't have a clock.  I typically don't wear a watch but have at time thought that it would be helpful if the display could set to either steps or time of day.Overall,  I would buy another Fitbit if anything happened to mine and I would recommend them to friends who are into fitness.",4,24.06.2014,Overall this product is very helpful.

55,A2RFH2KGE2S3JU,B00BGO0Q9O,Angelina Marie,1405296000,"Love my FitBit Flex, which I received 7/11/14. The last year & a half, I have been using the FitBit One but upgraded to the Flex because the wristband is more convenient for me than having to keep up with a tracker between changing clothes, showers & sleeping.I LOVE the Fitbit Flex but....the Fitbit website touts that the Flex is water resistance up to 30 meters. I was skeptical about the water resistance & a bit nervous but I thought I'd wear it while casually swimming in a pool this weekend. The pool is only 10 ft in the deepest area & I mainly laid out on a pool float to get some sun.When I got done swimming, I'd pull the tracker out of the wristband, dry the interior of the wrist band out with Q-Tips & make sure the tracker was dry, put it back together & go about my day.I even went through the same drying habit (since getting it 3 days ago) after my daily showers.Well, today I noticed condensation on the screen when I tapped it twice to check my progress; the dots looked fuzzy/out of focus.Figuring that I missed some moisture when drying it off, I pulled the tracker out and swiped the inside of the wrist band & the tracker but everything was completely dry.I tapped the tracker unit while it was outside of the wrist band & realized that it wasn't condensation inside the wrist band, it was condensation inside the tracker, which seems airtight & functional.As of right now, the tracker is working but the fuzzy looking dots are bothering me & I cannot get the moisture out of the tracker...Very afraid that the trapped moisture will lead to tracker failure later.I'd love to give it 5 stars because outside of the whole water issue, the Fitbit Flex is amazing & very very accurate.And so much more convenient than the FitBit One (which I still think very highly of)But the reality is, (to me) the water issue is a BIG issue & is making me very paranoid. I check the device every few minutes to make sure the Flex is still functional & now I don't want to wear it to work out (sweat) or when I shower...I guess only time will tell if the moisture dissipates or is the downfall of this amazing device.Will update post & ratings if there are any changes!",1,14.07.2014,Fantastic tracker so far but....

I have had it for a little over 3 weeks and it has already broke. The advertised battery life is about 5 days. It was doing that, but this past week I've had to charge it every 2-3 days. Not a huge deal, but annoying. Now it will randomly turn on sleep mode during the day. Last, I don't feel it is that accurate. So far it said my most active day was a day that I was sitting around in various doctor offices with my kiddo, so I'm not sure if it was tracking my movement by me lifting and putting down my child? But I know I definitely wasn't moving around much.Bottom line, way overpriced when it doesn't seem to accurately count your steps and the charging/sleep issues. Plus after only 3 weeks, and $100?

I used it for the first time until the charge wore down, and once it recharged I couldn't get it to sync.  I contacted customer service, and they offered me some troubleshooting tips.  Turning the device off using a paperclip actually did the trick, and immediately it began syncing again.  I used it fairly regularly from that point forward for about a month, recharging as needed.  After a month of use, though, the battery died and wouldn't recharge.  I've made my way through all of the troubleshooting tips I've found on their website, have revisited my first e-mail from Fitbit, and I've really just tried everything.

It came off as I shopped, as I just walked across the parking lot, etc.  In fact I lost it completely one day and decided it was not worth trying to replace it.  The Flex stays securely on my wrist, I love the fact that I can get various colors of the band, and checking the data on my phone is not really all that bad.  If there was a display on the tracker, I would have given it a 4 star.  If it was not so cumbersome to sleep in, it would have had a higher rating too.  All said, I continue to wear it daily and hope that eventually Fitbit will develop another wrist tracker that has a display.",3,12.07.2014,"Great for Tracking, But Some Drawbacks","Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black",92.85,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21ukcP7LNVL._SX300_.jpg,Fitbit,,714,features other,www.amazon.com/gp/profile/A3L5605REIYV48,0.087003968,0.458978175,244

My company offered a discount for the Fitbit Flex, so I decided to get the Fitbit Flex. For the last few weeks I wore this band, and the Jawbone Up band on the same arm. Below are the positive and negative aspects of the Fitbit Flex, as compared to the Jawbone.The Positive:+ Good design, it seems very durable, although the window seems to be easily scratched or marred.+ The BlueTooth sync makes realtime traking accurate.+ The band display is a convienent method for checking activity progress.+ The lack of buttons makes the band a bit more durable, the activation method for the band is simple.+ The band can be &#34;calibrated&#34; for wear on the dominant / non-dominant hand, improving band accuracy.+ The &#34;clasp&#34; for the band seems durable and does not come off readily on it's own / accidentally.+ If the band breaks or tears in some way, it is easy and cheap to replace.The Negative:- The band only has two modes: Sleeping and Active.- To activate or track an exercise activity the user must do it through the phone app, or online desktop.- The BlueTooth sync sometimes takes a long time to connect to my phone.- The data captured and displayed in the app/online is a bit simplistic (less detailed than Jawbone's).- The sleep data is not very accurate, even when placed in higher sensitivity mode.- The sleep feature only logs deep sleep as &#34;sleep&#34;, restless sleep does not count towards the sleep time.- The app is a bit anemic for being able to view data, and control the band (i.e. settings).- The alarm feature of the Flex is a hard time, unlike the optimal wakeup feature in the Jawbone.- There is no power nap feature like the Jawbone.- The band &#34;clasp&#34; is a little difficult do one handed.I work rotating shift work, and for me the sleep features that the Jawbone device are very worth while. Additionally, the Jawbone app provides a lot of information about my activity, and healthy tips, as well as motivational prompts. I have really enjoyed the BlueTooth sync with the Flex, and as a result I am selling both my Flex, and my Up band to buy the 2nd rev Jawbone Up24 band, and provides the additional BlueTooth sync feature.

154,A3L4U5U88JX06V,B00BGO0Q9O,"Coup ""Coup""",1405468800,"I have a LifeSpan brand treadmill desk, and this came recommended as a good accessory from other LifeSpan users to measure my fitness level since the LifeSpan software itself is really bad at doing that...However, after 2 weeks of using this band, my issues are:Not for biking or swimming:It does not accurately measure road biking exercise, and it is very sensitive to motion, changing settings when you don't want it to. For example, I ride my bike 6 miles a day on occasion, and it did not measure the exact 'steps' taken during those times pedaling. I would consider some of the hills to be intense activity level (red), but the monitor only showed up to yellow, and not for the hardest hill....Also, when hitting bumps or going fast on the bike, the band will vibrate a lot to notify me it has changed into the sleep setting. I then have to tap it to get it back to recording my steps...Not compatible with LifeSpan treadmill desk:It does not record steps taken on my treadmill desk if I am typing (like right now) because my arm wearing the band is not at my side recording the stride vibrations. The only way to use this with a treadmill desk where your arms are typing is to loop the band onto your pants to measure your stride motion, thus your steps, since your arms are stationary. For this reason, I am returning it because the whole purpose was to measure my improvement in health and well-being through using the treadmill desk, which it won't do...Sleep measurement is too vague:I used to own the Zeo brand sleep headband for measuring REM sleep, deep sleep, etc.. The Zeo is 10 times more accurate in measuring your true sleep, as it can tell you every 'level' at which you are sleeping, minute by minute. When I slept a recorded 9 hours through Zeo is said I had 4-5 hours of deep sleep and 4-5 hours of more shallow REM sleep. It was really accurate. I could literally remember having a long dream and it would show I was in a dream mode during that exact time....However, this band reports that I only get 1.5-3.5 hours of sleep total each night (where it senses I am 'not moving'), and that the rest of the time is considered 'restless' sleep where my banded arm is moving. The difference in what Zeo records and what Fitbit records is huge. But I didn't buy this to measure my sleep, so it's fine.Silent alarm is dangerous:I used the silent alarm function once, and it wasn't as reliable as my iPhone. Once I tapped it and it disengaged, I was able to keep sleeping endlessly without a 2nd or 3rd alarm as a back-up. With the iPhone, you can simply turn the volume down so that it only vibrates in your bed, and set an unlimited amount of alarms to ensure you will have to get up, so the 1st one can be a vibration, and the 2nd one can be a sound, etc.Force Sync is where?When measuring my steps taken on the treadmill, I wanted to force it to upload my data in 15 min. increments, and it could not for the life of me find the so-called 'zip' or sync area of the website or on my dashboard. I literally just can't find it...If it's there, it certainly isn't CLEAR.Hygiene is poor:As other reviewers mentioned, the band stores water near the electronic piece if you shower with it, water your garden with it, or sweat with it...when you remove the digital piece, you will notice a mildew smell, even after only 1-2 weeks of new use.Novelty 'wears off', pun intended:I imagine this is what it was like with those digital pets you fed to keep alive. The fun novelty of tapping the band face to see my progress throughout the day, as displayed through flashing lights, is wearing off after 2 weeks of use. I am returning it mainly because it doesn't work as a wrist band device with my treadmill desk if I am typing, as mentioned above.",2,16.07.2014,"Only measures direct impact foot movement with arms by side, not biking, swimming, or steps on treadmill desk while typing","Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black",92.85,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21ukcP7LNVL._SX300_.jpg,Fitbit,,1340,activity-tracking running calories,www.amazon.com/gp/profile/A3L4U5U88JX06V,0.107238067,0.471229805,690
155,AX7U03DQCPMHC,B00BGO0Q9O,Courtney Lloyd,1404777600,"I LOVE love love my Fitbit!! I've had the Fitbit Flex since around February and it has changed my life. The biggest impact it has had on me is that it constantly holds me accountable to my exercise and sleep. I have lost 20 pounds so far, by making diet changes, doing strength training exercises, and moving a lot.The Fitbit would not be nearly as amazing without the technology that goes along with it - the website and the app. When I have bluetooth enabled on my phone, my Fitbit data constantly syncs with my phone. I can check the app to see, in real time, exactly how many steps I've taken, how many miles I've walked, and how many minutes of my day have been &#34;very active&#34;. Within the app or the dashboard of the Fitbit website, you can customize your goals for each of these elements. During my first week with the Fitbit, I just went about my normal life and looked at my data at the end of the week. Then I set my goals for the following week to be slightly higher than the amount I did previously. For example, if I did on average 7500 steps a day, then I set my goal for the next week to be 8000 (500 steps more). Every week I look at my data and set new goals to make sure I am constantly improving and moving more. (By the way, I paid the $50 annual fee to sign up for the Premium account. The Premium part of their website provides you with so much data, weekly reports and graphs about your food if you log it, activities, and sleep. You can also download spreadsheets of your data through the Premium tab. I highly recommend this if you are very data-driven or want to keep track of your progress.)One of my favorite features of the Fitbit is the sleep tracker. Since you always wear the Fitbit, it can track your sleep each night, including how long you're actually asleep for, how long it takes you to fall asleep, and how many times you wake up or are restless throughout the night. This is usually the most interesting part of the Fitbit when I show it to friends.I've convinced multiple coworkers to buy and use Fitbits. Fitbits are definitely more fun when you have friends that use it also. You can add friends, and then within the app or website it shows the rankings among you and your friends in terms of who has the most steps. This is REALLY motivating and fun!! Since getting the Fitbits, we are all motivated to walk more and exercise, partially because we want to be in first place in steps. We also now have a reason to talk about our active lives and what we've been up to, and I've even started working out with some of my friends. It's amazing!I've had people ask me how accurate the Fitbit is. While I can't necessarily speak to its accuracy, I can speak to its consistency. That's good enough for me, because what matters to me is that I'm moving and that I'm moving more every week than I did the week prior.I did very recently start having problems with the battery life of my Fitbit. For the last few months that I've had it, I've only had to charge the battery about once every 5 days. I also set up email and text reminders about when my battery is low so that I never let it die completely. (I don't want to lose any steps or sleep data!) When I recently started having this battery life problem, my battery would drain every 12-24 hours. I tried the troubleshooting tips on the website and then sent an email to their customer service team. They were able to check the system logs and verify the battery life error. After sending them a copy of my Amazon receipt, they sent me a brand new Fitbit package free of charge, and without me having to send in my defective tracker first.I have been very impressed every time I've contacted their customer service team. I also contacted them to see if they have any larger size wristbands. The Fitbit comes with a small and large wristband, but the large is definitely not big enough to fit my dad, who is on his own weight loss journey. After emailing them about the larger wristband size, they got my shipping information from me and sent me an extra large wristband free of charge. Wow! Thank you Fitbit!If you're debating whether or not you should spend $100 on this, I absolutely say to go for it. The motivation and information that I've gotten from this device is worth much more than $100 to me personally. If you're someone that would wear a Fitbit all the time, then it's worth it.",5,08.07.2014,I LOVE love love my Fitbit,"Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black",92.85,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21ukcP7LNVL._SX300_.jpg,Fitbit,,1342,goal lose calorie food exercise,www.amazon.com/gp/profile/AX7U03DQCPMHC,0.22627322,0.459582626,818

All I need is to glance down and see how many lights are shining, and it get's me to stand up and get moving. I was a little worried at first, because with a pedometer, you can hide it a little easier. It's kind of hard to conceal the Flex when you're not working out. But, I found a cool line of fashion jewelry called Funktional WearabIes Fitbit Jewelry that actually hides my Flex, so it won't ruin my outfit when I'm not working out. I also love that I can track calories with this. I have always used a pedometer, but this is so much more than that. Now I get to see exactly how many calories I burned during my Zumba classes.

I did a LOT of research on activity monitors and the fitbit was actually not in the running for what I wanted due to the reports of inaccuracy. But, then I realized that it was really one of the only ones that was water proof and so I purchased it with hesitance.I'm very happy with the ease of using it. I charge while I'm relaxing watching shows at night. Not every night - once a week or so. It has only come off a couple times and those were both related to wrangling wiggly children who didn't want to be where I wanted them to be.The waterproof is a must for a mom if you're wanting a monitor that goes on your wrist. My arm is plunged under the water while washing the kids, sprayed while filling up the water toys outside.. etc etc.now, for the 'review' part.. I like trend data. I really like to see how I'm doing on a long term scale. That is very nice. And being that it's consistently inaccurate, that's fine because my trend data remains an honest trend. but I feel bad for my friends who have the fitbits that go on their waist bands, etc. because sometimes I think that they would higher numbers than me if I had the same type. On the other hand, maybe not...what I've noticed is that it tracks too much movement. For instance, when I rock my children - be it rocking to sleep or rocking in the recliner while we read books - it counts the movement. I've also had it vibrate and alert me that I've reached my goal while I'm on my knees playing with the kids or washing them in the bath. so, not entirely accurate.it seems to work well with strollers and grocery carts when my arms aren't moving.",5,26.06.2014,the mom review,"Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black",92.85,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21ukcP7LNVL._SX300_.jpg,Fitbit,,1939,wear work shower water,www.amazon.com/gp/profile/A30JY9GNRTPU6T,0.177121212,0.498484848,316

I love challenging myself to beat yesterday's steps, it's gotten me on the treadmill more times in the last month than the whole year prior to having it.Here's the problem that you should before aware of when you make your purchasing decision: BATTERY ISSUES!!!The Fitbit forums have soooo many battery issue complaints it makes me wonder what percent of Fitbit's have had batteries replaced. Mine is 6 weeks old, battery has had issues for the last 4 weeks and now it won't charge at all. It seems customer service is pretty good, replaces batteries several times on any given unit. My issue with that is, what kind of quality product needs that much replacing and if I really am using it, all the downtime that I can't use it makes me wonder if I really 'need' it. As of right now, I'm waiting to hear what can be done about my battery.PS - warranty is one year.Had I read about the battery issues in advance, I would have figured there are always grumblers and bought it anyway. Now, after all these battery headaches and realizing exactly how many others have the same....I still love it, but not sure it's ready for Prime Time.

I don't like wearing watches or bracelets, but this doesn't bother me at all.I like the app/website to log calories and water intake.The lights keep me motivated without having to know exactly how many steps I've taken.The battery does last several days.The sleep portion is interesting because I didn't know I woke up/moved so much in the night (okay, I did, but not what times), and the weekly log they send via email shows how well I slept for the week.I like the weekly email telling me how I did the previous week on steps, calories, sleep, etc.My husband is a large 6'5"" man and he loves it and is motivated by it too. He sweats a lot and the band stays put and lives through the sweat bath. And the large band fits him (on the last tick lines). We compete with steps and it's fun!Negatives/ other comments:Sleep mode isn't perfected. My band will sometimes go into sleep mode during the day after some movements (clapping, holding a nail for hammering, using the blower or mower, etc.), which is irritating because I don't realize it and I miss out on steps. I wear it on my non-dominant hand too. Also, in the night, sometimes I sleep on my arms and with the bracelet on my wrist, it pushes into the backside of my wrist and causes my hand to go numb, so I haven't been sleeping with it as much.I wish it had a clock on it since I'm already having to wear it on my wrist.I don't wear it in the shower even though it says it will be fine. I take this as my break from it, and how many steps am I really going to get in the shower?It doesn't sync to my iPhone 4.

When I lose it, I'm going to have to buy another one, but it would be preferable to be able to use my phone charger.It would be good if it could go longer without needing to be chargedIt will not sync to my smartphone (it's an older smartphone).

It does help keep me motivated to exercise and be active every day (or most days). But after over seven months of use I am very disappointed with how the Fitbit system has held up. I have to fiddle with the Fitbit charger 10 or more times before it starts to charge; one of the wristbands completely has completely fallen apart and the others look pretty worn out (and I rotate between four of them so they don't get over-used); and our Aria scale stopped working a few weeks ago. Also, the iPhone app really sucks - you have to go through four or five steps to input exercise, the silent alarm takes over a minute to set, and the whole system is constantly offline for &#34;maintenance.&#34; I would not recommend this product to anyone - if I could return it I would.

I like that the Fitbit is comfortable, not too big or bulky (I have tiny wrists). I also like the app for the most part it is a good product overall. I am a little disappointed with the data base for calorie tracking, it is not very accurate, and it is difficult to customize. I use my app (that I purchased prior) to track my calories and then just deduct it from my daily on the Fitbit app. I also do not like the fact that the exercise calorie counter is not very accurate (active calorie tracker). I work out 6 days a week and purchased this device because I am breastfeeding and need to stay on top of my calories, so accuracy is pretty important.

In general, any fitness tracker like this (whether fitbit, jawbone, nike, etc) doesn't live up to the hype.  Value-wise, I think fitbit is a best buy if you are going to get one of these devices.The fitbit alone will not cause you to lose weight.  It's not a magic potion. Honestly, at first it is pretty cool.  You can use it to track your sleep, but I'm not really sure what you are going to do with that information because in general you probably already know your sleep habits.  It can be fun if you get some family or friends to &#34;compete&#34; in the rolling 7 day step count.  You can set a goal (ie default goal is 10,000 steps) and it will vibrate when you hit the goal.  That could be motivating.It comes with both a large & small band.  Generally women will wear the small band.  Mine broke after a few months (some don't even last that long).  Instead of shelling out $15 for a replacement, I just trimmed the large band so I could wear it.  There are some additional colors you can purchase.  I think there could be improvements to the band.  I have seen tons of comments about them breaking, although I have been pretty lucky.This doesn't track your heartrate and some activities won't really register anything (ie, if you are on an elliptical with stationary handles it doesn't give you any credit).Overall, I think it is cool at first but the allure wears off quickly.  Accuracy is debatable.  The app seems pretty limited (my husband has a Nike fuel band and their app is much better).  For the cost, I honestly think you are better off to just buy a $5 pedometer.

I wear it almost constantly and I've yet to have a band break or fall off. There's a ridge on the clasp in the middle of the prongs, and the first side of the band has to be pushed past that before you can put the second side of the band on the clasp. Also, the plastic &#34;clasp&#34; that comes with the extra bands isn't meant to be used as a clasp; it's meant to hold the bands together in the packaging and that's it. (I've seen a LOT of people complain that the &#34;plastic clasp&#34; breaks.)I have sensitive skin and a nickel allergy, and I haven't had any rashes or irritation while wearing my Flex. I had an issue where the tracker wouldn't hold a charge for as long as it should, but I contacted Fitbit customer service and, once they asked the obvious questions, they sent me a whole new one. I ended up with an overabundance of bands, but on the Fitbit website there's a message board to trade bands with other Flex users, so I traded the two small violet bands I had for larges in other colors I wanted.Someone complained that the Flex retains a lot of water after showering with it on. It does, but it's a good idea to take it off and dry out the tracker and the inside of the band anyway so the charging contacts don't get corroded. I wore mine to the Color Run, and it still works just fine after being caked with colored corn starch, with no staining of the band at all. My shoes did not escape staining nearly so well!I have a 6 year old who seems to think everything is indestructible, and he LOVES to mess with my Fitbit, so the fact that I haven't had a band break on me actually means something. I have a small teal band that I wore a while (before I realized that the larges are more comfortable for me), and it shows some wear, but it's not anywhere close to breaking; mostly the corners have rounded off a bit.I like that the Flex keeps track of my steps throughout the day. I've tried other pedometers, and they get caught on things and pop off; I lost several that way. The sleep tracker is nice, too, and I like that I can sync my Fitbit with other apps like SparkPeople, MyFitnessPal, Nexercise, and EveryMove; it saves me the trouble of having to enter my steps manually.As long as you know what you're getting and you keep your expectations realistic, this is a great tracker.",5,30.06.2014,Fibit Flex works great for what I want.,"Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black",92.85,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21ukcP7LNVL._SX300_.jpg,Fitbit,,2768,wear work shower water,www.amazon.com/gp/profile/ADBG81ZG0O7SI,0.096515152,0.39512987,459

323,A3W9UJR67GL4E,B00BGO0Q9O,J. More,1404259200,"After working with the Fitbit for about 3 weeks, I have developed a deep affection for the device but have also learned that the Fitbit under-counts the number of steps by a huge amount. I was interested in- Steps taken- Distance travelled- Active minutes- Calories burnedHow accurate is this data? Read on to find out, but although the quality of the data is iffy, the Fitbit is a fantastic tool for keeping active.  On other issues like setup, sleep anaylsis, web interface and the iOS app (after the latest update), the Fitbit rates very highly.-- Steps takenI tested the step accuracy by walking for 15 minutes, using the GPS in a Garmin to measure distance, and a clicker to count the steps.  The Fitbit recorded 1,059 steps, and 0.6 miles, while the clicker gave me 1,707 steps and the GPS claimed 0.91 miles.  These numbers show that the Fitbit data is about 60% of the actual data. This is a huge difference!!!  I have repeated this test with similar results; in all cases, the number of steps was at most 70% of the actual numbers.  I have learned to live with this lack of accuracy by modifying the number of daily steps in my goals; instead of 10,000 steps, I aim for 7,000 steps.How about the number of steps if you log an activity? Below is data for some activities:- Vinyasa Yoga (1 hour): 68 steps- Rowing at 150 watts (15 minutes): 230 steps- Body Pump (1 hour): Varies between 774 and 942.- Cycling at 15-16 mph  (1 hour): 3,927 steps- Cycling at 16+ mph  (1 hour): 2,750 stepsIf you equate steps with effort, then these numbers are low (compare them to walking for 1 hour). But this is intrinsic to any device that measures effort via arm movements. You just need to adjust your goals, not a big deal.-- Distance travelledThe Fitbit measures distance by multiplying the number of steps by the stride length; if you have not set a stride length in your profile, Fitbit derives one from your age and height. Once I realized this, I lost interest in distance (I can multiply numbers).-- Active minutesThe only way that I could get Fitbit to credit me with active minutes was by logging an activity. Otherwise Fitbit is stingy with active minutes. For example, today I did more than 10,000 steps but only got 2 active minutes. Sigh!-- Calories burnedWhat is a calorie? Seems to depend on the person, heart rate profile, and body efficiency.  Estimates from heart monitors and other devices vary by huge amounts, so I use them to indicate trends.  Below are the numbers from some activities as measured by Fitbit and the data from the HealthStatus site- Vinyasa Yoga (1 hour): 434 calories, HealthStatus 574 calories- Rowing at 150 watts (15 minutes): 127 calories, HealthStatus 142 calories- Body Pump (1 hour):  357 calories, HealthStatus 400 calories- Cycling at 15-16 mph  (1 hour): 601 calories, HealthStatus 696 caloriesIt looks like Fitbit consistently gives lower numbers than HealthStatus so you can use this information to adjust the number of calories burned to stay at your weight (or whatever).  HealthStatus claims that 2128 calories is the right number for a moderately active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week) man of my age and weight, so I am using 2300 as my goal; I may revise if my weight starts changing.",4,02.07.2014,Amazing and addictive but accuracy is an issue,"Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband, Black",92.85,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21ukcP7LNVL._SX300_.jpg,Fitbit,,2795,activity-tracking running calories,www.amazon.com/gp/profile/A3W9UJR67GL4E,0.11454886,0.528560224,561

The program figures out how much you can eat based on your goals and activity, and with a couple clicks you just log what you eat, and fitbit gives you a running count of your calories, fat, carbs, protein, even sodium and vitamins.  More so, it tracks your steps per day, calories,activity level, even your sleep patterns.  It's almost like I'm competing against myself to meet my goals.  It really gives me the incentive to stay on track and meet my daily goals. I'm finding that it stays charged for about 5 days and will notify you on your dashboard when the battery is low.

I purchased one for myself, one for my little sister, and one for my mom after Mom had a heart attack at a very young age.  She's competitive - we all are to an extent - so the fact that we can see each other's progress was an important feature for us.I love it, but I'm not going to tell you anything about why that isn't available in many other reviews.  I'm reviewing this product to share a bit of information that you might not know: call you health insurance provider and inquire if they give &#34;wellness&#34; or &#34;preventative&#34; benefit allotments.  I was pleasantly surprised to learn that my plan does.  My doctor submitted a note to the effect that he wanted to encourage me to walk more, and they reimbursed me for 75% of the cost.  At nearly $100 per flex, plus getting us each a pack of extra bands at $30 each, that is worth checking into.  Their insurance covered Moms but not sisters.In the spirit of honesty, I will disclose that Mom had had a recent heart attack and I have a prothesis in my leg.  That may have factored into why ours were reimbursed and not my little sisters; that said, she's also only 14 years old, so it's equally likely that she doesn't qualify for &#34;wellness&#34; and &#34;preventative&#34; in the same way that an adult might, or even that her maximum allotment was used up already by school physicals and such.  However, it's worth it to check your insurers policies on this sort of thing.

This was definitely a design flaw since it tore at a point right where the actually tracking mechanism is entered into the bracelet.A little picky here, but the device also does a terrible job at picking up activity outside of running/walking such as lifting, push ups, or ab exercises.

379,A3R80QHA0L0XOL,B00BGO0Q9O,kform5,1403568000,"My husband and I have both carried pedometers for a while.  We put them in our pockets at the beginning of the day and checked them out when emptying our pockets at the end of the day.  It was &#34;nice&#34; to see how many steps we took.  A co-worker fell in love with her Fitbit and while raving about it she convinced me I needed one too.  Father's Day was around the corner so I purchased one for my husband as well.They arrived promptly and in excellent condition.  Instructions to set them up were easy to follow, and maneuvering through the iPhone app is a breeze.  Having the Fitbit easily accessible on the wrist means it gets checked throughout the day, waaaay more than the pedometer ever did.  Also, considering we both always seem to have our noses in our phones and/or tablets we've started using the food and water trackers as well, making us both more cognizant of how much of each we're consuming as well as how an increase in activity effects calorie intake for the day.  We also get competitive with them, &#34;racing&#34; to see who takes more steps, cheering and taunting throughout the day.  The sleep tracker has also made me more aware of how much sleep I am getting each night as well as the quality of sleep.  I'm a little more conscious of what time I am going to sleep at night now and the result has been me feeling more energetic throughout the day.About 2 weeks ago I began having difficulty charging the Fitbit.  I found myself having to jiggle it in the charger, moving the charger up, down and side to side (think of the old days with bunny ear antennas and swearing at the television),  It was annoying and I thought I would have to return it.  Instead I checked out the Fitbit troubleshooting site and followed the instructions by using hand sanitizer and a tissue to clean the charger and Fitbit.  It worked instantly.I do wish it could track activity in conjunction with swimming, however that is the only real shortcoming in my opinion.  Overall the Fitbits are making my husband and I much more aware of how much activity we are getting during the day (especially on work days), as well as how we're re-charging our bodies at night and what we're fueling them with.

Now I will say this device is a life changer for someone you needs to lose weight the right way. I have a very analytical personality and this caters to my need to prefect my diet and exercise routine and it is fun. It is true that you will automatically park further away in the parking lot just to log a few extra steps, and if you have a dog you walk...he will also benefit from your Fit bit, as you will also automatically want to take him/her on a much longer walk. When I first got the fit bit, I had 50 lbs. to lose. I was barely achieving 5000 steps in a day. Now I have 5000 steps logged by noon everyday and I am walking 11000 per day. It does take some effort to get to 10000 plus steps, but now my dog enjoys three long walks around the neighborhood a day instead of only one. I do not have to starve myself to lose weight. The software tracks how many more calories I can have in a day based on my current activity. If I want to consume that scoop of ice cream, it tells me how many calories I am over and I know how much more activity I must do to burn off that scoop or two or three of strawberry ice cream...I have now purchased one of these for my 76 year old mother. I believe she will purchase one for her slightly younger sister and brother in-law as they are fairly active and in their 70s. I believe this is a great present for family and says you care about their health...or that you think they are fat....ha-ha depending on the relationship you really have with them..ha-ha. Anyway, have only had mine for a week and have already shed 10 lbs. and I am not starving, I am still consuming 1200 to 1500 calories a day. I feel that finally I am losing weight the right way and in a way I will be able to maintain and not lose to only put it all back on a year later. I have been a yoyo dieter for over 20 yrs.

It's a great product if you are only interested in tracking your steps and you like to walk or run for exercise.  However, you can just buy a pedometer if that's what you want the fitbit for.  It only tracks activity if you're swinging your arms so if you're riding a stationary bike or walking through Walmart pushing a shopping cart you will get no credit for that activity.  I worked out for two hours and 10 minutes the other day and when I got home my fitbit dashboard said I had done 7 minutes or activity.  I was not pleased.  I also work a second job and am constantly walking around the store so I thought it would be interesting to track that activity, as well.  The problem is that I am often carrying stuff and not swinging my arms so it doesn't register that I'm doing any activity.I was also disappointed that it was not compatible with my Ipad 2.  It only works with a 3.It &#34;tracks&#34; your sleep, as well but if it tracks my sleep like it tracks my actual daily activity, I have no confidence that it works well.

Jensen,1404864000,"Like The device, but here are my issues with it.First the band is not built to stay on while more more rigorous activities like yard work or water sports.  (just 2 examples)  The band easily pulls off and I am constantly backtracking trying to find it.Over the 4th of July weekend I was wake surfing.  This is a sport that requires of whooping 10 mph of speed to perform.  During one of my falls the band pulled apart and is gone!  Very frustrating.  Why build an activity monitor that can only withstand light activities without falling off?Suggestion:  Offer a band with a buckle clasp ever if you need to charge extra for it.  Your band clasps are Micky Mouse to say the least and I have worried about losing it from the day I received it!Issue 2).  If you are doing any work like hammering, shoveling or anything else where shock pressure might radiate through both hands/wrists, the device will think you are trying to put it into sleep or awake mode - so the mode is continually (accidentally) changing with repeated jolts.Suggestion:  Incorporate a mode that locks it into regular activity mode and prevents it from going into sleep mode.I have truly enjoyed my Fitbit, but refuse to keep buying new devices that I know are just going to fall off.

However,  there would be two free/fee feature services built into the device.First,  it would sync a few hours of Prime music based on your preferences and /or their recommendations.  The fee-based enhancement could alow you to pull in music beyond the prime offering that comes with Prime music.Second,  they could tie into an automated coaching program that provides recommendations based on your progress or lack thereof.  The coach feature can provide a audio or text game plan at the start of the day or after you put on the device.  It would provide a signal (audio or vibration)  when it has more feedbackor motivation (based on your historic fitness data).  You can ignore the signal if you don't want your music paused or in the event that you are not interested.  The fee-based enhancement could allow you to subscribe to Amazon Prime trainers at various levels of integration.All of this would become personalized as you set preferences and try recommendations.

I subtract calorie consumed from the calories burned. I thendevide by 3500 ( for a pound ) and it is exactly what I have lost for that week.

I like the vibration when I hit my step goal. Wireless syncing on the computer is quick. It's waterproof and battery holds a charge for a while (I have had it for about 2 weeks and have charged twice only out of an abundance of caution).The cons: Not sure how much I love being tethered to a wristband all day, but that's just me getting used to wearing something that's monitoring me. That's a definite adjustment. The band is thicker and bulkier than I expected. Many people have reported issues with the clasp, and yes, it is a silly way to construct the device. Of yet the only problem with it is sometimes difficulty closing it, but I rarely take it off. I can see how it will become an issue, though.The biggest problem for me is as follows. The first couple of nights, I tapped the thing repeatedly to get it into sleep mode. Each subsequent morning, I'd do the same and regardless, it would happen within a matter of seconds (no more than 3 or 4). Now, having had it (and worn it in the shower and ocean - but less than 10M), the tapping seems to be a lot less successful and I often have to tap repeatedly for 10 or more seconds. It's highly annoying and does not bode well moving forward.I haven't used the food app so I can't speak for it. It does sync with My Net Diary, which is the food diary/app I use.

I need about 20% more steps per day as measured by the Flex to get the same health effect as steps measured by the Pulse or One.

I took a long trip and was pleased that it tracked my information for the entire 7 day trip.  Be aware that it will only sync with the pc or tablet that has the dongle installed so you won't see the tracked information until you get back and sync if you are away from it for a long time.I also bought a Withing wireless scale and it was easy to link it all up to my Fitbit account.

544,A2MPC320MCN96,B00BGO0Q9O,pax3,1405209600,"I have now owned three Fitbit devices in the past six months.  It started with the Force.  The Force is definitely superior to the Flex.  It was accurate, responsive, and the display was easy to read and conveniently displayed data.  But like the Flex, the strap would not stay secure on my wrist.  The Force would fall off numerous times while doing day-to-day activities.  Fortunately, I was able to find the Force after it fell off even after losing it in the Apple store (kudos to those folks for finding it and holding it for me).  The day eventually came, though, when I couldn't find it after it fell off while walking my dog.  I was very upset because the Force was not a cheap product at $130.  I sent an email to customer service explaining that the Force wouldn't stay on my wrist and was now lost and they sent me a Flex as a replacement (due to the skin irritation issue the Force was taken off the market.  I had experienced some skin irritation with dry, itchy, red patches but it wasn't enough for me to stop using the Force).I received the Flex and began to use it.  Not having a display like the Force was disappointing.  I also noticed while clapping, the Flex would jump into sleep mode.  It would also go into sleep mode while I was riding my bike due to bumpy terrain.  Yet again, it would go into sleep mode while I was cooking if I tapped a spoon/spatula off the side of a bowl.  This was very frustrating.  It fell off a few times but I was able to find it.  Then, about a week after receiving it, I needed to charge the device.  I placed it in the charger and it would not charge.  I tried everything that the Fitbit website recommended and it would not respond.  I sent another email to customer service explaining that it wouldn't charge and asking for a refund for the Force, especially since I had experienced skin irritation.  I was told that since I had &#34;lost the device&#34; I could not receive a refund.  This was very infuriating since I had not lost the device, the faulty strap would not stay on which was no fault of mine.  I was sent yet another Flex.I received the Flex and once again began to use it.  Less than a week since I received it, it fell off my wrist while carrying bags to my car.  It fell off in the street and I didn't realize it until hours later.  I found just the strap, which had been run over, in the street.  I have emailed Fitbit's customer service again and told them that I am done with Fitbit.  It's not worth the frustration.  I will just eat the $130 that I paid for the Force.While I appreciate Fitbit's helpful and polite customer service, I am appalled that a product that costs $100-130 is so faulty.  I have noticed that there is a company that makes a small device that goes around the Fibit Flex's strap so that it will stay on.  It is simply ridiculous that one needs to pay an additional $10 so that the strap will stay on.  Obviously there is a design flaw.The app and website are great.  It works seamlessly with MyFitnessPal and it is a great motivator.

I performed all of the actions (including reinstalling the device).  However, it did not remedy the issue.My reason for my low rating is the support.  It was completely unprofessional and worthless.  First, they do not have a phone or email support.  I opened up a case.  I told them that I tried these support articles in my case ticket, and it did not fix it.  The response I got was a canned ""do these support articles and let us know"".  To appease them, I REPERFORMED the tasks I asked them to do, and it still did not work.  I sent a request on July 6th.  Their web site says they will respond within 2 business days.  It is now July 11th, with a daily request for an update.  There has been NO response.  There are NO escalation opportunities to call or email someone.Now I have a $99 step counter with NO software and dashboard data to use.  I could have gotten a $10 one for this functionality.  I paid $99 so I can get the data and software behind the scenes.Again, faulty products can occur.  I expect that and can be patient.  But absolutely HORRENDOUS customer service is inexcusable in my estimation.If I do get a better response from Fitbit, I will alter my review.

I've always wanted to know how restless I am at night and this does that by tracking your movement when in sleep mode. The only thing I don't like about it is that it doesn't track your heart rate and therefore during workouts when I'm doing movements such as push-ups or mountain climbers, i.e., movements where my arms aren't moving, it can't detect that and therefore won't count it. However, on the app you can log your activities and if you enter in the amount of calories burned, it will then compensate for that on your activity log. Speaking of the activity log, you can also track your food consumption which is amazing. When it comes to diet and exercise my biggest downfall is the diet and with this it tells me how many calories I've consumed/how many more can consume and tracks consumption of protein, fiber, sodium, etc. All in all I give this little tracker a 4 out of 5.

The fitbit is a fine piece of hardware though the battery technology must be two generations old--we really should be able to get a week or more on a single charge.  Probably the best benefit is that it makes you focus on fitness--what you eat and how much you move.The iOS app is average--clearly not a highlight of the fitbit and the iPad version is just a double-sized iPhone app.  It's nice that you can sync up via Bluetooth to get instant readouts but  that doesn't make up for the poor user interface and the difficulty in finding things in the app.  If someone comes along with a comparable fitness monitor but a good iOS app, I'll be making a change immediately because the real value of the fitbit is in the information that you get out of it, and the app is a key interface.The sleep monitor function is the most frustrating part of the fitbit.  Its never clear whether the fitbit is in sleep mode or that you've woken it up in the morning.  When it works, it works fine.  But more than half the time I end up with either 16 hours of sleep (with 9 hours of awake or restlessness) or 0 hours of sleep.  It's inconceivable why they can't use the LED lights to provide a more intuitive display for the sleep mode.I recommend the fitbit as a good tool for losing weight and staying fit, and avoiding the sedentary lifestyle that an office job produces.

My purpose of buying this was to monitor how many steps I take a day.  I have a &#34;desk job&#34; and worry that I do not get enough exercise.  I set my goal for 10,000 steps a day.  I know that I will not reach my goal with the job that I have, so I also walk on the treadmill at least 4 miles a day.  This combined with my normal walking puts me well over 10,000 steps per day.  I also use the dashboard to log my sleep.  It is great to know how many hours of &#34;true&#34; sleep you actually get in a night.  I have from time to time logged my weight but do not want to focus on this.  It also has the great feature that you can log your food.  I currently do not do this.

The two most useful features are that it makes it fairly simple to keep track of my calorie intake, which I have found to be a must in losing weight and weight maintenance.  The second feature, of course, it that it seems to give a good estimate of my calorie burn each day. So, for example, if I want to diet and lose about a pound a week, I know that on average, my calorie burn needs to exceed my calorie intake by about 500 calories/day on average.  Even though the calorie burn is an estimate, I have found that my weight loss is usually very close to what my calorie deficits would predict.  Both the calorie burn and intake require some effort, as there is a fair amount of manual input to get the most accurate results.  But if it helps me to improve my health by motivating me to keep my calorie burn up and my intake down, it is well worth the work, to put it mildly.  The sleep monitor is nice to have, as it helps me to be accountable to get more sleep.  The website has some useful features, such as inputting plans for weight loss, increasing calorie burn, etc.  I don't wear the band in the shower, even though they claim you can, as water gets inside the tracker holder, and makes a great place for molds, etc to grow.  The tracker can get hard to recharge, as the contacts have to be kept free of oils and skin debris that can accumulate, otherwise, this is a very easy to use device.  My first flex tracker lasted about 13 mos before going bad.  I purchased another one immediately, as I have come to depend on it.

At first I was a little unsure of how I would like it, since the device is worn to track stats, however, in order to view your stats you must log in to the website.  So far, it's not that big of a deal.  I don't have a smart phone, so I just go home and sync my fitbit every evening.  I also thought there should have been some sort of instructions within the box.  I'm looking at it thinking, okay, now what.  Once I logged into the website, set up was very easy.  I've used the sleep tracker, but still can't quite understand how it determines that I am awake.

678,A110QY87X4FVB1,B00BGO0Q9O,Tina,1404950400,"I originally had the Fitbit Force, which I loved and would have given 5 stars, but it was voluntarily recalled, so I sent it back and then got a Flex.  I love that the Flex came in the violet color - that's what sold me on it.  I like that it tracks my sleep patterns and shows how many times I was restless during the night.  And I like that I can track my progress towards my daily goal by how many dots light up when you tap it.  Five dots is your daily goal, so if you're at 2 dots + 1 blinking dot, you're about half way there.I am anxiously awaiting the Force (or something similar) to come back, as I much more preferred to see the actual number of steps I had towards my daily goal, as well as the time (eliminating the need for a watch).  I really miss both of those features.  The other thing I like about the Flex (and the Force) is the &#34;silent alarm&#34; - that vibrates to wake you up.  The downer is that I have to sync it to my computer because my phone is a dinosaur &#34;4&#34; (prior to the 4S that syncs automatically with the Flex). When I was traveling in a different time zone, my alarm was vibrating at 3:15 AM and I didn't have my dongle on my work laptop to manually sync it and change the time zone or alarm.  Lesson learned - adjust the alarm or time zone before the next trip!!

You MUST be online to sync it and review your stats. This is a huge flaw. I was out hiking for a week or so and lost a couple of days activity because I couldn't sync.There are still places in this world (thank god) where you cant get a cell phone signal let alone a wireless connection for you tablet, phone or what ever you are using to track with.2. You can only make one sleep entry and you can not edit a sleep event. Once you set a sleep log you cant go back and modify it or change it in any way. Occasionally I have to get up in the middle of the night to work on international projects. I may get up and 2 and go back to bed at 4. It does not allow you to do this.3. The calories burned and the database that FitBit provides is lame. You can only keep about 20 items on the usual list and you have to search the database for other foods. It is EXTREMELY limited and a pain in the ass to keep track of custom foods you might add.Seems that their software, which is key to using this device, is pretty immature and needs significant additional development to make it work well.They tout that it will count levels (floors if you will) that you walk. I take the stairs up 8 flights every day and it never shows any of that activity.

But that's not quite how the flex has actually worked.  First of all, it must be charged every 4 or 5 days, and the small band is (as another reviewer described it) almost impossible to fasten on your wrist.  I ended up using the large band so that I could snap it together off my arm and then just shove over my hand and on my arm like an oversized bracelet..  Unlike another reviewer, I have a very difficult time removing it from the band (so that it can be charged in the separate charger that does work well)) and then getting it back in correctly.  After two weeks, my small band broke; after three weeks, the large band broke (and I just ended up scotch taping it together since the bands are so costly.  The final difficulty is the synching.  One time out of 4, the automatic synching doesn't work, so it has to be done manually.  And after 2 months, the software no longer works even manually (and after being turned on and off and rebooted).  I wanted it to be easy; and that is clearly not the case - at least for me.There's no way to determine how accurate the device is, but it is relatively correct (although my son says that it doesn't count steps when you're pushing a grocery cart).

As a stats geek, losing weight is more fun because of the hourly/daily/weekly/monthly stats on my sleep/steps/heart rate.You can always buy the heart rate strap later, any brand as long as it uses ANT+ 2.4GHz wireless technology. I saved a few bucks doing this.Pros:-With the Garmin Connect software, I can determine when I am least active.-I never have to think about putting it on or charging it.-It seems to actually know what is a step and what isn't a step, with two exceptions (see cons).-The Garmin Connect software is compatible with MyFitnessPal.-The step count matched the count of a non-digital pedometer and my phone's App Pedometer.-The distance was extremely accurate, matched the distance when measured by GPS on my phone.Cons:-It fails to count steps when I am pushing a shopping cart.-It will record thousands of non-existent steps during sex in bed.-It may fall off, especially during physical activity.-I cannot sync with my Android 4.2 smartphone, so I can only sync with laptop. I can't speak for iphones, but this requires Android 4.3+.Strap Solution:On the 7th day, my strap snagged my shorts and almost fell off.

I followed the instructions on the Garmin website to pair my device to my computer with the ANT stick, and it worked...for a few hours.  It keeps asking me to pair it, again and again.  I called Garmin, who admitted it is a problem with the device.  I have two choices: I can mail the DEFECTIVE product back at my own cost (yes, I realize this is likely only a few dollars, but it is the concept of having to pay for something that is DEFECTIVE), OR, I can provide a $136 &#34;deposit&#34; and they will ship one out to me and then I can ship my defective one back (at my own cost).  I managed to convince the garmin rep it is ridiculous for me to pay for shipping, but I still had to put down the deposit to have them ship me one first.  And, they have NONE available to ship for 2 weeks.  And then it takes 7 to 10 business days to arrive.Needless to say...I would not purchase this product again.

710,A2DXIAS7ZFOCOV,B00HFPOV26,Ashley Mescher,1405468800,"So this is my thoughts on the garmin nuvi: what I really love: it tells time; it tells me when I have been inactive for a significant amount of time by putting a red line on the screen and to get rid of that line, you have to do enough walking to your heart rate gets going, not just a few steps down the hall; it is relatively light, so I got used to it being on my wrist very fast and you can get different bands other than the ones it came with; it is water-proof, so you can swim with it and wear it in the shower; it has a count of steps taken and counts how many steps you have left until you reach your goal and how many miles you have walked; it monitors your sleep and you can set a general time you go to sleep in case you forget to set it on the nuvi (putting it in sleep mode is very easy- you just have to hold down the button); the battery is supposed to last a year, and you never have to charge it because if the battery dies, you just replace it like any other watch; you can sync it with Bluetooth on your phone or with an &#8220;ant&#8221; that you plug into your computer (I plugged my ant into my work computer). There aren't many things I do not like about it. I had a hard time with the mobile app the first couple days, but that was user error. Also because it counts steps by the movement on your arm, it doesn't count steps while you're shopping and hoping a shopping cart (which looks weird when you are maneuvering one with only one hand- but its worth it in the end) and will not keep count by having it in your pocket- I called and asked because I like to use it all the time, but not with a dress, and that is when they told me about the arm movement. It really keeps me moving which my orthopedic doctor wants me to do since I sit at a desk all day and need to get up and move around to prevent it from getting worse or hurting.

712,A6DCEWGYU7N7Q,B00HFPOV26,Avid Non Avatar,1404432000,"I  purchased the Vivofit and had only been using it for two days, but already had buyer&#8217;s remorse. It does not compare at all to the product that I was replacing - the Fitbit Force being inferior in almost  every regard, except for the band. To be fair here, in my opinion, are the good and bad points of the Vivofit - all with the baseline of the Force in mind:The Good:1. The band: It is lighter, easier to clasp, comes in more colors (this is important - although I am a guy I do like to color coordinate. A big plus is that you can switch out the bands.2. The band II: The Vivofit comes with both a small and large band (!!). Are you listening Fitbit? This is a much bigger deal than you may think, particularly if you are purchasing mail order (Amazon) as you do not have to worry (and we all have too many things to worry about already) about getting the right size. 3. The band III: As indicated in #1 above, you can purchase additional replacement bands &#8211; of course in different colors.4. The power source (battery): The Vivofit has two small batteries that the manufacturer (Garmin) claims will last for one year and that are replaceable. I much prefer that setup rather than having to recharge them as with the Force. Perhaps not all will agree, but for me this is a plus.5. Water-resistant: The manufacturer (Garmin) claims that the Vivofit is waterproof to 50 meters. While I still would not swim with it on as it does not, according to several sources accurately record that (swimming) activity it is nice to know that you do not have to take it off for activities such as washing your horse (or car) at the wash rack.&#61514;The Bad:1. Synch: You will have to manually synch your Vivofit. Although the synch is wireless you will still have to press the button on the wristband. The Force, as you know if you have / had it, performs the synch in the background when you are close to the dongle.2. The display: It is not backlit and is, again in MHO, difficult to read in low light, let alone in the dark. One thing that I loved about the Force was it&#8217;s bright LED display, and miss it solely in comparison to the Vivofit.3. The display II: Perhaps this would not be a negative if I were not used to the Force, but nonetheless it does bother me that the display is always on with the Vivofit. I liked the &#8220;off&#8221; status on the Force and actually, unlike some comments that I have read, not only do not mind that I have to toggle it on to see the display but see that as a nice feature; I think it adds a bit of a &#8220;futuristic look&#8221; to the product.4. The display III: Clicking through the display screens has a &#8220;clunky&#8221; feel &#8211; not the same smooth sensation as the tactical feedback from the Force&#8217;s. Again, highly subjective, but hopefully valid for anyone considering transitioning from the Force to the Vivofit.5. The band: Yes, there is something that I do not like, nay, hate, about the band, and that is the lengthwise (across the wrist) placement of the readout module in the band. This, for me odd, placement means that you have to either **ahem** your head, or twist your wrist, to read the display. The placement on the Force is along the length of your wrist (not across) and allows you with a quick glance to see the display.6. Functionality: The Vivofit does not record &#8220;active minutes&#8221; as does the Force. Yes, if you buy the additional (or have a compatible) heart monitor it does track heart rate. I for one dislike putting on the heart rate tabs, and, frankly, do not do high rate cardio so for me (again) the lack of tracking of continuous activity as &#8220;active minutes&#8221; is a downside. (I had been tracking 60 active min. a day and will miss that benchmark!)7. The web site: I do not even know where to begin on this point as there are so many things lacking / not up to par when comparing the Garmin Connect site to the Fitbit site. Thus I will be brief and list just a few of the points:a. The site requires you to input your birthdate. A small point for some, and of course you cannot provide the real one if you wish, but being in an industry where I know all too well how easy it is to combine bits of data from different points to build up a profile of a person I find it objectionable that Garmin requires you to either provide this data or to lie. I think this is such a &#8220;big deal&#8221; that I am listing it first on my issues with the site.b. You cannot track your calorie intake, i.e. unlike Fitbit there is no option for adding foods. This, for those wishing to become more conscious of their healthful (or not so) eating patterns is something that they will miss.c. You cannot record &#8220;offline&#8221; (i.e. you have taken off your Fitbit) activities. I did this often with the Force &#8211; either recording swimming time or time on my bike. Again, yes you can import these (and other) types of activities from other Garmin products into the Vivofit but that of course requires that you both have those other products and or a need for them. I do not and simply desire a (one) good product that tracks my walking and the input of other optional activities.d. The site has a tremendous lag time, that in a comparison using the same connection and with the same web browser as what I used for the Force and the Fitbit site.e. Besides the aforementioned lag time, the site has refused to open several times, and that just over a two day period of time. Now, I will admit that is a small sample size, however given all of the other negatives of the site / product it is of note.I wish that some of the above had been pointed out to me before I purchased the Vivofit. While some things were mentioned, not all were, and certainly not those things which I find the most lacking when comparing the product to the Force. I did purchase from Amazon, as I did the Force, and did not have an opportunity to &#8220;test drive&#8221; the Vivofit, relying instead on reviews. I am not complaining, it was my choice, I am just pointing out the lack of detail that I was able to find by way of a caution (to do better!) if you are considering purchase of the Vivofit.",1,04.07.2014,Do NOT waste your money!,Garmin Vivofit Fitness Band - Teal Bundle,169.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41AvI4o2GFL._SY300_.jpg,Garmin,,6056,features other,www.amazon.com/gp/profile/A6DCEWGYU7N7Q,0.1239445,0.484476861,1134

Despite its recall, I continued to use it because I really liked it. But it died after 6 months. I will be returning both. So I did a bunch of research and decided to get this Vivofit. I was immediately excited that I didn't have to plug it into my computer to charge. It runs on battery and can last up to one year. The Fitbits last four to five days on a charge and seem to always die when you are away from home. Next Vivofit seems much more accurate in keeping track of my steps. It also adjusts my goal for each day based on the prior day. I will be testing the heart rate monitor next week as well. The only thing that Fitbit has over the Vivofit is the silent alarm.

720,AM5BLE3S8R2O,B00HFPOV26,"Bob ""lukes""",1405036800,"Garmin vivofit the best on the market right now.I have had a fitbit flex since March.  I got the vivofit in July, not from Amazon.  The fitbit is a good device but the vivofit is superior in almost every way.  I give it a 5 but it is not perfect, but it is the best on the market.The BAND.  The band is really no different than the fitbit, it may be perhaps better or at least feels better.  It&#8217;s comfortable just like the fitbit.  But it has the same design flaw as the fitbit does, maybe not a flaw but a design decision.  It can get snagged on things and easily rip open.  I have, on more than one occasion, looked at my wrist and noticed my fitbit was gone.  Luckily I found it every time.  The garmin has the same issue.  What may cause some people who switched from fitbit to garmin more angst is a simple change that garmin made over the fitbit.  The band clasps are opposite directions.  Imagine swinging your arm forwards past your leg, on the garmin this motion could catch the clasp and un-clasp it where it wouldn&#8217;t on the fitbit.  Swinging your arm back past your leg could un-clasp the fitbit but not the garmin. All assuming you are wearing them both on your left hand.  As most have said, get a bitbelt, tape, or something to back up the clasp.  Garmin, include a bitbelt in the package and you are golden.  Also I am one of those people with sensitive skin, I can&#8217;t wear most watches because they give me a rash.  I have had no problems with this band or any rash.USE.  It&#8217;s a pedometer.  It counts steps, not stairs which is a bummer.  I never really believe the calories these devices count, but it does that also.  I like the little red bar that reminds you to get up.  If you sit behind a desk it is a nice feature that will remind you that you have been sitting for a long time.  Didn&#8217;t think I would care about that feature, but I have come to like it.  It tracks sleep, does it just like fitbit.  Neat feature, I use it just to see how much sleep I get in a week.The DISPLAY.  I love the display.  I love having the physical button and not just tapping it.  Also I think many people have missed the point of not backlighting the device.  I am personally glad it&#8217;s not backlit.  When you go to sleep that last thing you want is something lighting up your wrist.  I guess if they offered a button where you could turn on a backlit that would be the best of both worlds, but I don&#8217;t miss a backlit at all and I am glad it is not backlit, give me battery life instead.  Also, having a clock and date is awesome.  This feature seems simple but it&#8217;s great.I didn&#8217;t think I would care about the time, but honestly, this is one of my favorite features.The BATTERY.  I love never charging it.  This is such a plus and is so overlooked by most reviewers.  I hated charging the fitbit every 5 days.  It would often give me a low battery at the worst times, travel, etc.  It&#8217;s not a big deal to some, but I just didn&#8217;t want to have to worry about charging another device.  This is a huge advantage over the other devices, huge.ACCESSORIES.  HR capability.  I haven&#8217;t used it yet because I use HR with my edge 800 for biking mainly but I plan to sync my HR strap and test it out on a hike this weekend.The SOFTWARE.  Fitbit is better, for now.  Seems like garmin as made some improvements but I think fitbit is a bit cleaner and easier.  But I have no problems with the new Garmin modern site.  Syncing was much easier with the fitbit.  They just did a better job with the sync process.  Not that Garmin is difficult, just not as good.  For example you have to press sync on the device itself.  Just a step that the fitbit doesn&#8217;t have.  I like recording my weight everyday into garmin/fitbit sites and tracking it.  Just being aware of the weight has helped me lose a few poundsBIKING.  This is the main reason I was looking for something else besides fitbit.  Using the fitbit while biking, it would randomly go into sleep mode, and it would add a ridiculous amount of steps.  I tested this on 7/10 wearing both devices.  I rode 12 miles and the fitbit added 8000 steps and the garmin added 900.  The fitbit went to sleep more than 10 times.  I guess the vibration of biking causes the fitbit to sense taps which put it into sleep mode.  I have had the fitbit go into sleep while driving also.  Maybe I wore device too loose.ACCURACY.  I tested it against my edge 800 gps and it is pretty good if you are walking.  I think both the fitbit and garmin are fairly accurate, or at least similarly accurate.  But, none of these devices are very accurate.  Expect  mile accuracy over 8 miles.WHATS MISSING.  Not having climbing steps.  This is the only feature I would really like.  If they would have had this it would have been the perfect device on the market right now.  Its wider than a fitbit and a little taller.  I wish it were a little thinner, but that is just a wish list because I have no problems with the thickness as it is.SUMMARY.  Best on the market but get the bitbelt rubber clasp, use electrical tape, or something as a backup.  If you choose the fitbit, do something to secure that band also.WHY get this or any fitness device.  If you want something to track your weight just giving you a better understanding of your habits, it&#8217;s a good idea.  For me, I wanted to track sleep and make sure I was getting enough walking in during the day.  I sit behind a desk all day and easily lose track of time,  so I needed a reminder to get up.",5,11.07.2014,Garmin vivofit is the best tracker on the market right now.,Garmin Vivofit Fitness Band - Teal Bundle,169.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41AvI4o2GFL._SY300_.jpg,Garmin,,6073,activity-tracking running calories,www.amazon.com/gp/profile/AM5BLE3S8R2O,0.210648303,0.521724076,1029

Johnson,1405814400,"I bought this knowing about the issues with the band falling off, so I put 3 small hair elastics on it before wearing it the first time to reinforce the clasp a bit. It fell off anyway within the first couple days when I was carrying my toddler in that arm. I tried switching it to my non-carrying arm and it snagged on something else and fell off again. So far I've been lucky and noticed, but I'm getting worried that it's fallen off twice in just one week of wearing it. I don't take it off, either, so it's not because I'm fidgeting with it and making the clasp loose.I have been using a Fitbit Zip and I was ready for something I didn't have to dig in my shirt to read. I love having my steps displayed right there on my wrist in a nice large font - it really is motivating on the days I haven't moved much. The lack of light doesn't bother me since I can't read my analog watch in the dark either. I'm having fun with the sleep tracker too - I had a nightmare one night and it was pretty obvious from the graph what time of night it was. Fascinating!I thought I would like the red move bar as a motivator since I tend to sit at my computer too long in the evenings, but it doesn't register all my small trips around the house doing chores. So the bar lights up all the time, not just during computer time. I have to walk 100-200 steps without stopping to get it to turn back off. It is working, I am moving more, but I find it more like nagging and less like positive motivation than I was hoping.I have it linked with MyFitnessPal and my calories show up in the Connect app, but my steps don't show up in MyFitnessPal like they do with my FitBit. How am I supposed to know how much dessert I can eat if MyFitnessPal won't give me credit for steps??? (Maybe I should consider that a feature instead of a drawback.)Overall I'm happy with it, but for the price they REALLY need to fix the band issues.

736,A6RH4ONCY5YIQ,B00HFPOV26,C. M. Dougherty,1404000000,"Bottom line: Per usual, Garmin nailed the hardware, but saddled it with buggy, unfinished, and incomplete software.I bought this unit after after owning a Fitbit Force and having it recalled because of skin irritation. Compared to the (now-discontinued) Force, the Garmin's hardware is vastly superior in most ways, but the &#34;modern&#34; version of Garmin Connect is buggy and incomplete.The Good:- Excellent wristband / clasp system: My Fitbit Force constantly fell off my wrist at the slightest provocation. Despite the clasp looking pretty much identical, the Vivofit has yet to come off unintentionally. Also, the Garmin comes with two wristband options of different lengths.- Non-rechargeable battery: This is a no-brainer for an item that's supposed to live on your wrist all day, every day. I had a routine with the Fitbit where I'd recharge it while I was showering, but I still had it fun out of juice on a few occasions. The Vivofit's battery is supposed to last up to a year, and is easily replaceable.- Water &#34;proof&#34;: Again, a no-brainer for something that's supposed to be on your wrist throughout the day. The Fitbit was water-resistant, but you weren't supposed to do things like shower with it. The Garmin is, for all intents and purposes, waterproof (unless you're a diver).- Big display: It doesn't light up (to preserve battery life), but it's big and legible. I thought the angle of the display (perpendicular to the arm) might bug me, but it doesn't.- The Red Bar of Death: This is the best feature of the Vivofit. Other fitness trackers like the Force vibrate if you've been sedentary too long. The Vivofit is both more subtle and more forceful in how it pushes you to stay active. If you sit for an hour, you'll see a big red bar on the display. Sit for another 15 minutes, and you'll get a smaller red bar on top of that. You'll get an additional three red bars if you stay inactive for two hours (at which point I guess the Vivofit gives up on you). Getting up and walking removes the bars, but the more bars you have, the longer you'll need to walk to get them to disappear. It's remarkable how motivating it can be to make the bars disappear.The Bad- No stair tracking: The Vivofit doesn't have an altimeter, so it doesn't track stairs. It's not the end of the world, but other trackers can do this.- Unlit screen: The Vivofit's screen isn't backlit to save battery lift. 99% of the time, this isn't an issue. It is problematic, however, when you're trying to track your sleep. I often find myself hunting around for my iPhone so that I can light up the screen and see if I've activated the sleep mode.- No vibrating: To save battery life, the Vivofit doesn't vibrate. If you need or desire tactile feedback, it's not the tracker for you.The Ugly- Garmin Connect: The new &#34;modern&#34; version of Garmin Connect is a hot mess. It's missing basic features (such as food/calorie tracking). The interface (both web and iOS) is unstable and buggy.The biggest failure is also the most perplexing given Garmin's background making fitness devices: Garmin Connect doesn't aggregate all my activities and calories (in terms of inputs and outputs) into one comprehensive graph. As I mentioned, Garmin Connect lacks a calorie tracking feature (although you can sync it with MyFitnessPal, that requires downloading a second app, creating another log in, and screw it I have better things to do with my time...). Worse, however, is that if you have another Garmin device, it keeps that data and the Vivofit data separate.I ride bikes, and I track my rides using a Garmin Edge 500. Garmin Connect shows me the calories I've burnt while cycling under the &#34;Cycling&#34; tab. The Vivofit data is kept under the &#34;Health & Fitness&#34; tab. You'd think that the &#34;All Activities&#34; tab would aggregate my Vivofit and Edge data together to give me a comprehensive report. You'd be wrong - it just shows cycling activities. There is (to the best of my knowledge) no way of seeing my Vivofit and Edge information together. It's as though two different people are using the devices, one who only walks, and one who only cycles. It's ridiculous.This comprehensive view is, in my opinion, the most important feature for fitness tracking, because it helps you understand (roughly) if you're expending more calories than you're consuming. Fitbit.com (using FitDataSync.com) could automatically import Garmin Activities and display them in an aggregate view with my Fitbit Force data. That's right - Fitbit was better at integrating Garmin data than Garmin Connect is at integrating ITS OWN DATA.It's pathetic, but it's par for the course with Garmin software, which is pretty uniformly awful. My hope is that Garmin Connect improves over time, or that someone else devises a better means of integrating data from the Vivofit and other Garmin devices. Garmin has begun direct integration of its data with Training Peaks and MyFitnessPal, but it's also apparently charging those companies exorbitant sums for access to their API.Despite all those negatives, the Vivofit is still the best fitness tracker on the market. If you don't need to aggregate data from an Edge/Forerunner, then it will work splendidly.",4,29.06.2014,"Great Device, Mediocre Software",Garmin Vivofit Fitness Band - Teal Bundle,169.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41AvI4o2GFL._SY300_.jpg,Garmin,,6107,data use monitor information,www.amazon.com/gp/profile/A6RH4ONCY5YIQ,0.149168213,0.500932282,876
737,A1S4NBWJG0Q0HR,B00HFPOV26,"Coarsegold ""Dan""",1405728000,"First a couple of observations then on to the real point of my review:-My personal solution for the issues with the clamps on the band is this: Just do a search here on Amazon for: Gardner Bender 46-104UVB 4-Inch Black Heavy Duty UV Resistant Cable Ties, 100-Pack.  Besides the fact that the solution costs $0.0435 cents per application, you will find endless other uses for them. Having these around the house is essential for all kinds of tasks!  Once one of these small ties is on the band (just below the black square locking block) the tie will virtually disappear and you will never even notice that it's there.-I like the Garmin unit, and it fits perfectly with my intended use. I feel I have made the right choice in a tracker for me.  As someone wisely pointed out, the whole secret to being happy with a tracker is carefully analyzing your person profile and need on this type of toy:  I like the fact that the screen gives me information and motivation on a continuous ""on"" basis, and then of course, being waterproof and the 1 yr watch battery design is a strong plus. Other contenders in this space would not have been right for me, but may be perfect for you.  The choice is highly personal and subjective.-I do want to note, perhaps it just the particular unit I have or the way it interacts with my motion patterns, BUT mine is rather ""optimistic"" in the steps taken around the house or office. It is dead on accurate on a real intended cardio style speed walk, or on an elliptical trainer, but just hanging around the house it's giving away steps for free. This is not a deal killer, but I have begun subtracting a certain amount from my daily totals, just to keep the game honest.Now on to the real point of my review. Others have detailed everything about the technical features and use of this tracker, so I won't bother going over all that again.  I want to get into some new ground that is pushing on the whole world of web assisted trainers, trackers, diet planners, and on and on.  Here's the issue at hand:Do you want to share what might be considered highly personal data with others unknown to you?  Do you understand that you might be in danger of loosing control over your own data?  I would have vastly preferred that Garmin would have made the software that analyzes the data collected by the tracker as a stand alone program that runs on the target op system, whether that be PC, Mac, Android, or iOS.  The fact that it is web based opens up a Pandoras' box of privacy and security issues.  Not to mention the fact that web based client sever solutions are useless if you are, like me, occasionally packing into the back country where the raccoons and bears have not yet installed internet access !Yes I understand that you can supposedly, on your account, ""turn off"" the social media aspects of the servers software, but it very definitely is collecting your personal data, and that data is fully under the care, custody and control of Garmin Inc.  They can do what they want with it well into the future. That in itself is very dangerous.  In the fast moving world of Silicon Valley, the arms of ventures are sold off all the time, and the data from the old owner goes to the new hands.  In fact, usually, what the new owner wants is that data!If you think I am fantasizing about these dangers just ask any of the tens of thousands that used an iOS based application called ""MOVE""  to do exactly what you are doing with your Garmin tracker,  only to find out, that,  without warning or agreement, their personal training data (including their real names, birthdays, friends contact lists, etc. etc..) were sold out to Facebook..  Mark Zuckerberg & Company obviously paid millions for  personal data that he can re-sell to advertisers, not because he thinks ""cardio training is cool""...  He doesn't give a hoot about how those folks training was going or that maybe his programmers at Facebook could help them tomorrow with their diet and cardio.  He bought something for cheap that he can re-sell for dear.(you can read all about it, just use you favorite search engine and look for ""Facebook buys Move"")What is in control of all this is that little check box that you click on without thinking when you sign up for web based client server software just like Garmin Connect or MyFitnessPal.  It's called a ""privacy agreement"" and an ""End User License Agreement"" .. Have you ever read one?  Probably not, so what follows here is a highly condensed abstract of a typical one that I found attached to very well known fitness tracker program for my iPad.  In all fairness to Garmin, theirs is much less onerous, and Garmin is a very tightly wrapped and well run organization, so this is not a direct knock at Garmin today, but it's tomorrow we need to think about, as per my example above,  and it's also all the ""add-on"" software that Garmin is linking to in their web-based site.OK..

742,AMMBDINDR7L3L,B00HFPOV26,Elizabeth Icenogle,1405555200,"I was so excited about this product that I waited months (pre-ordered) instead of buying a different product.  (I was ""trading in"" my 3 y/o bodybugg.) Yes, it does about everything it advertises it does. No qualms on offerings - I understood what I was getting into.  Do note that the Bluetooth technology is so advanced that it may not sync with your current phone.  If you are excited to use the app, do a little investigating ahead of purchase.One star rating: There is a major design flaw. While sleek and comfortable, the wrist band pops loose.  It is not secured like a normal watch band, it has what I would call a peg/hole design. The rubber of the watch is flexible - generally a positive - until it doesn't securely hold your investment and tool on your body like it ought to.  With an easy bump of a jacket or everyday object, off pops the device.One of the reasons I was so excited about the watch was that it would track my running and I could wear swimming.  A week ago I was open swimming in a lake.  I'd been in ocean (wading) and pool previously.  As I was swimming, off popped the watch as my hand/wrist/arm entered the water with a stroke. It was like a slow-motion version of a movie.  It disappeared and I wasn't able to recover it.  (I looked for a long time.)I reached out directly to Garmin to petition for a replacement since I plunked down the $169 for the heart rate monitor package.  I don't want to be on the hook for an entire new get up.  The best they could do?  A replacement for $69.00 - 50% off the watch.  While their customer service was courtesy and seemingly well-trained, the fact that they won't stand by their product is unfair, and, I believe, a bad practice.  A friend had her fitbit replaced when she accidentally put it through the wash.  And that WAS the customer's fault.CNet says of the watchband: ""The only problem is that the band sometimes pops off, a problem with this type of band design. Be careful when wearing jackets or cuffed shirts."" And then Gizmodo mirrors this comment with: ""Also, the clasp comes undone too easily for something that's supposed to be sports apparel."" Amazon sells a product that advertises to keep the wristband from popping off because of a flaw: ""protect your investment.""It is not just me.  This is a flaw with the product, as opposed to a choice in design (no backlight, no alarm, no GPS etc).  I am not willing to re-invest in a watch with a flaw, but do think the company should be willing to replace.  Instead I believe I'll look to other competitors and see if I can sell the HR on geartrader.com or craigslist.  At least I'll have something to reinvest.

The instructions at the Garmin website are a bit better, but I still found myself searching the Internet with my questions and referring to other people's blogs and posts on how to make adjustments.

757,A1TTMH9HSG2FBQ,B00HFPOV26,"Jack Flakne ""jackflak""",1403827200,"I really like having a daily step counter on my wrist, as I often forgot to carry my old pedometer with me on some days.  Out of the box, the distance counter is not accurate at all, and it takes a long time to fine-tune it to your stride, before it becomes accurate.  The sync feature with so-called Garmin Connect is cumbersome, and works maybe half the time on the first try.The Garmin website is truly terrible, and the people from healthcare.gov could have done a better job.Mine came with the heart rate monitor, and, despite how uncomfortable it is to wear, it is nice to see your heart rate as you go.  When the HRM is on, the band creates an activity log, and strangely, it becomes even less accurate.Don't even consider yourself with the calorie counting features of this, as they are hilariously inaccurate and inconsistent.  This morning, I jogged on the treadmill for about 25 minutes, and Garmin Connect logged it as 26 minutes, and my pace and distance were correct to within about 10%, which I found acceptable.  The site said I had burned 183 calories, which made sense.Later this evening, I put on the HRM and cut my grass with a push mower.  After 20 minutes, it claimed I had burned 485 calories, which was not possible.  Simply put, it's not possible to use it to measure calorie burns to within even 50% accuracy, as there is no rhyme or reason to it.The only way to accurately measure distance walked or run is to look at it, and manually make a note of your total, and then compare it to when you are finished.  The readings on the band are somewhat accurate, but somehow, when &#34;synced&#34; with Garmin Connect, they are changed, and are not close.If you have to buy this band, keep an old-school log yourself by reading the band.

What swayed me to it as opposed to fitbit and nike fuel is the red line indicator.  I picked my up in an online auction for $110 shipped and I've recently acquired another for $99 for my husband You just have to be patient if you want to save some money and not get into a bidding war.  Anyways, I work at a desk and I can go hours without moving so while it would be nice to have an alarm that gently wakes me up or have it illuminate so I can see in the dark, I mainly need the &#34;hey, get up and walk&#34; reminders. Also, water resistant and year long battery is nice too.It appears to be really accurate. I counted 100 steps and it recorded 99 steps. There are a few different screens: time, date, steps, calories burned, steps to go to achieve the goal for today and distance. I'd say with the constant reminders, I walk 2.5-3 miles daily now.  Once I've been idle, the red bar starts creeping along the display. And it grows if I don't get up and walk.The website is so-so. I never seen nikes or fit bits website so I cannot compare.  Each week you compete against strangers to see who has the most steps.  I'll admit I walked a bit more so I could win the knowledge of being first out of the 10.  There is a sleep monitoring section which I don't really use cause I sleep like a log but I must be getting up to pee at night cause I get movement around 2am.  This interfaces with myfitnesspal which I really like cause it gives you a net calorie calculation.  I see a lot of potential in the website as time goes by.Syncing... I haven't had trouble syncing with my computer with this vivofit. I have trouble with my other garmin watches though.  My brother in law has a fitbit and he was saying his goal is 10,000 steps a day. My vivofit keeps upping my step goal.  I don't know if it's trying to challenge me but right now, my goal is almost 11,000 steps. I think it started at 8,000 steps when I first got it.What I hate about it: the red line. Sometimes, I'm tired and I want to chillax in my bed. Like right now. And the red line is back despite me having done 10 miles already today. Ok, I haven't moved in a bit but I'm way over my step goal so I think the red line should go take a nap.  But for some reason, if I don't get up and walk to get rid of red line, I feel really guilty. Like I'm letting vivofit down. It would also be nice if it had an alarm and illuminated so I could see it in the dark but that would sacrifice battery life.Weight lost: none. I only lose weight when I diet but my legs are toning up. If used in conjunction with myfitnesspal, this would be the best weight loss tool.Overall, I recommend it if you are a desk jockey or sedentary.

787,APWJMNLW1GLMX,B00HFPOV26,"Liz Wright ""Liz""",1404864000,"Ok, my cardinal health sin is sitting too long.  So, I wanted a device that would remind me to get up.  And that's the reason I picked the Vivofit over other devices.  And I love that it is a watch, a step counter and a reminder. I also wanted something that would give me the number of steps I've taken without having to check another device.  Overall I am happy with this but there are several issues.#1 If you have an older iPhone or iPad, it will not sync with them.  Anything older than an iPhone 4S or an iPad 3 is out of luck.  Which I unfortunately discovered after I had bought it.  This means I have to log on to my computer last thing in the evening if I want my data to be recorded.  Logging on the next morning means all the previous day's data is lost.  If all you care about is whether you made your goal and not whether the data is saved, it's not an issue.#2.  There is a delay between taking the steps and watching them show up on the Vivofit.  Sometimes the delay is almost 1/2 a minute.  So, there are times I think it's not recording my steps and then all of a sudden I'll see a big jump in the number.  This may or may not bug you.  But it does take some getting used to it.On the plus side, it's great to just put it on your wrist and forget it.  I have enough trouble remembering to charge my phone, let alone a step counter.  It is easy to switch between wrist bands, if color coordinating is your thing.  (Different colored wrist bands can be bought separately.It's funny that it takes a device to remind me to move, but such is life.  I have found that in just a few days, I've changed my routine from sitting to watch tv to walking in place while my shows are on.  So, for right now, happier than not with the Vivofit.Update- I have since discovered that I do not have to log on last thing at night.  The device will save the previous day's info.

791,A2XQBV1Q3V8H5K,B00HFPOV26,Matt,1404864000,"I recently ordered a Vivofit through my work (so not a verified Amazon purchase but I promise I do have one) and I definitely appreciate it to this point. To touch on some things other people have written:-A lot of people have had issues with the device popping out and then losing it.  Frankly, these people are either stupid or aren't wearing it right because this fits securely on your wrist. I don't know why so many people have had issues with this. The clasp is tight and to get the actual device out you have to really press down on the back button.-I've heard that some fitness bands will deduct an abundance of steps while you are driving. In my experience, Vivofit doesn't do this.  I have about a 30 minute drive to work, and it will sometimes count about 20 steps for whatever reason. It's strange, but it doesn't completely alter your total numbers for the day.-Many people had issues with the software not syncing. For me, it works perfectly. They may have released an update along the way before I bought this, but anytime I plug in the ANT stick and hit the sync button it starts within 2-3 seconds. My ONLY problem was the initial set up. I own a lot of Apple products, but I don't get a new one every time they get released.  I have an iPhone 4 and a Mac I bought in 2010. Apparently, the software on both of these is out of date for Vivofit, and the app is NOT made for iPad. Fortunately I was able download the Mavericks OS from Apple for free and run it on my Mac, but it was a hassle to get started.-Step counting is sometimes erratic, but I find that to be mainly doing things around the house.  For instance, standing still after a shower and drying my hair sometimes knocks off 50 steps.  Then I will walk around my room and no steps will come off.  At the end of the day, it probably balances out but I can see where this is frustrating. Going for a walk though, this thing is pretty accurate. I counted my steps from the car to my desk and it was almost dead on. If you're doing more intense workouts, it may lose some of that accuracy though. Also, it definitely counts steps while you are going up or down stairs. I checked frequently early on and it does count those.-The red bar is a good reminder to get moving.  That shows up after an hour, then additional, smaller bars tack on every 15 minutes. Generally you have to move about 150-200 steps to clear 90 minutes of inactivity. I think I prefer this method to one that vibrates because sometimes at work you can't just get up and move, you have to finish what you're doing.It may not be for hardcore fitness junkies, but as someone who is casually trying to be more active, I think this is perfect.",4,09.07.2014,"Mostly good, not sure why so much criticism",Garmin Vivofit Fitness Band - Teal Bundle,169.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41AvI4o2GFL._SY300_.jpg,Garmin,,6301,activity-tracking running calories,www.amazon.com/gp/profile/A2XQBV1Q3V8H5K,0.1358309,0.527219034,504

The fee-based enhancement could alow you to pull in music beyond the prime offering that comes with Prime music.Second,  they could tie into an automated coaching program that provides recommendations based on your progress or lack thereof.  The coach feature can provide a audio or text game plan at the start of the day or after you put on the device.  It would provide a signal (audio or vibration)  when it has more feedbackor motivation (based on your historic fitness data).

Some people complain that you have to hit a button when you sleep to record sleep mode, this is not a big problem and very easy once you get used to it.  In the first week you might forget to record your sleep, I did -is this really that big of a deal?  Of course not.  This device works great with any ANT+ heart rate monitor as well.  Integration with your smartphone is easy, intuitive, and pretty darn cool.  The Garmin connect website is pretty expansive and fun, and continues to improve.  The step challenges through Garmin Connect add a pretty cool competitive, social aspect to staying active as well.  For an outstanding in depth review of the Vivofit I suggest you go to DC Rainmaker website, his reviews are awesome, and cover just about everything about any device he reviews.Okay! So here is the MAJOR design flaw of the Vivofit - the band WILL FALL OFF OVER TIME. Just because yours hasn't yet, does not mean that it will not in the future!  Trust me!  I have used this band extensively since it was released , and I am very active and have 3 wild kids.  At first it was pretty secure, but over time it is scary how easily the band will pop off, and it is so light that you will probably not even notice.  Mine fell off 5 times before I remedied the situation.  Through reading the various Garmin blogs and through trial and error I have discovered and used 3 different methods to remedy this major design flaw by Garmin.  Please do yourself a favor and utilize one of these methods before you lose your $130 device.1)  Use 1 or 2 common O rings: Important is that is must be a Size #9. I found mine in at Home Depot in the section where the toilets are (not in hardware or plumbing section, that would make too much sense :)This method is by far the cheapest, at $2-3, and it is very effective at keeping your Vivofit on you wrist where it belongs.  The O rings did not bother my wrist much, not at all whilst doing activities, but after a long computer session using a mouse you might have a nice line dug into your wrist from the O ring like I did.  The one big problem with using O Rings to keep your Vivofit from falling off is that it makes it much more difficult to take your device on and off.  If you leave your Vivofit on 24/7, this is a great method, otherwise, please read on...2)  Order a FitBit:  Available at www.bitbelt.biz/.  These are basically a little rubber watch strap band that you might find on many  typical sport watches, except they are designed specifically to fit your Vivofit band.  These are available in many colors, if you want to add a splash of color to your band and keep it secure on your wrist.  This method is nearly as effective as the O Rings, and makes taking your Vivofit on and off a snap.  Some people have complained that the FitBit digs into their wrist, speaking for myself, the mark on my wrist was no better or worse than the O Ring method.  This method is a bit more expensive than the O Rings, coming in at about $10 for 2, and you can pick you colors.3)  Order an Elite Road ID:  Available at www.roadid.com .  This method is expensive compared to the other 2 at $30-$40, and requires a bit of work as well.  If you want to go with this method for securing your Vivofit, make sure you purchase the Elite model, this one is a PERFECT fit for your device.  Basically with this method you just hijack all the metal parts off your Elite Road ID and attach them to your Vivofit.  You have to cut the ends of the rubber Vivofit band and attach the metal, sports watch quality Road ID clasp to the Vivofit.  It sounds complicated, but it is very easy and takes less than 5 minutes.  This method makes the Vivofit incredibly easy to take on and off, and it is very secure.  The only downer to this method is that it does add a bit of weight to the device compared to the other methods.  On the plus side it also makes the device look more high end and classy, in my opinion.  You can also keep the metal Road ID badges on your Vivofit, with your emergency medical contact info, or whatever else you want to put on there.  I am an avid triathlete and road biker, and I decided to put my blood type on there too.  So with this method you get a great 2 for 1, a road id bracelet combined with the best fitness band out there, the Garmin Vivofit.I hope that my review has been helpful, and if you are on the fence about buying a fitness band, get off it!

I purchased this because of the reviews I read and the fact that you don't have to charge it for about a year.  This aspect has been amazing.  It is so easy to sync its ridiculous.  I will say though that the app is nothing spectacular.  The sleep part of the app isn't even working properly but evidently they are working on that as we speak.  I would hope that at some point they would overhaul the app and make it better but otherwise I am happy.  The pros other than the ease of charging and syncing are that its very comfortable and secure on my wrist.  It's also easy to put on and you can totally wear it in the shower and get it wet.  Its also pretty cool looking.  I like the whole thing with the red line but I work at a desk job so I fight that red line all day which is pretty funny.  But it does get me up and moving.  My hubby has the fitbit which is fine but he has to charge it all the time.  I had the body bugg which is probably more accurate with calorie burn but I have to hook it up to sync it and charge it which was a pain but their software was way better.

803,A1BOYE7B77RPCI,B00HFPOV26,"Mounir ""moroccomole002""",1403913600,"it's a close call, but the vivofit wins by a little bit, and here are some of the reasons why:1) I really like being able to see real-time step information, which I couldn't do with my flex. This is partially because my phone didn't support Bluetooth synchronization, but having the number displayed on your wrist is still way easier than having to open up an app on your phone and synch every time you want to see your steps.2) Not having to mess with a battery is awesome. My flex charger never really worked right, and a lot of times I would have to rub the electrodes with a q-tip soaked in alcohol to get it to charge. If I made it past the first couple blinks I was good, but the day I ordered my Garmin I just couldn't get it to charge and I was fed up with the hassle.3) I love my watch, but if I ever decided to not wear it I could use my vivofit as a watch which is kind of cool.Here are some of the downsides:1) Maybe I was spoiled by the flex bands that almost never came off, but I do find my vivofit wanting to pop off sometimes.

If you can read from the side of your kid's homework to make certain it's correct, you'll be fine.The clock is accurate and stays &#34;on time&#34;.

Unfortunately it appears short of $400ish you're not going to find one that does.  Pick up a Polar and wear that and the Polar transmitter in the pool in addition to your Vivofit for the best tracking.Parents and caregivers take note: this product does NOT track if you are pushing a stroller, cart, or wheelchair.  At all.  The best solution I've found is to take the tracker out of the wristband and place it on the inside of my ankle horizontally inside my sock.  All other attempts at tracking have failed or been VERY inaccurate.Mileage is REALLY inaccurate.  I walk 1 mi. and it thinks it's 2.5.  Pedometer is accurate, but apparently I'm the Jolly Green Giant and can cover massive amounts of territory with those steps.Wrist strap is unreliable at best.

821,A2IVIC1VJ8EE90,B00HFPOV26,RiverPoet,1404518400,"I pre-ordered the vivofit, and have been wearing it daily since I received it in March. The setup was fairly easy, though I had issues (again) using the Garmin software with my PC. When I switched over to my Macbook, it went better. (Have to do the same with my Forerunner 220 watch... Garmin software and PCs do NOT play well together.)Unlike other reviewers, I've never had the band come apart and fall off. I run trails with it, wear it at the gym to do weights, wear it for yard work, while doing woodworking, etc. I take it off daily to shower at home (though I leave it on to shower at the gym - I like that it's water resistant), so the band has seen regular use. I do keep it quite snug around my wrist so it's nearly impossible to catch on anything; maybe that's the difference? Regardless. The display is clear, I love not needing to charge it, and syncing with the app via Bluetooth on my iPhone works well. Having my data from the vivofit and my 220 in one place on Garmin Connect is nice. (The web site is another conversation entirely... my review here is just for the device.)The one drawback is that you can't calibrate your stride length, even an average between running and walking, so the calculated mileage is WAY off. Not even remotely close. Since I don't use the vivofit for that, it's not an immediate concern, but you'd think it would be something you can set. And because mileage is off, I'm sure calories-burned is incorrect, but I didn't buy it for that, either - there are too many variables needed to calculate actual calories used that I would not trust that figure on any device. Why fitness equipment manufacturers insist on including calorie calculations, I have no idea... I guess it appeals to calorie-counters. But it's not a number I believe or trust. Do your own calculations there.In short, the vivofit does what I bought it for - it counts steps and lets me see my sleep activity. It uploads to the same place as my running mileage, so my data is in one place. It also shows date and time, so I can use it as a watch as well as a fitness tracker. It reminds me when I've been sitting too long. I don't have to charge it weekly. Ergo, it meets my expectations for the device.Edited to add: I did a 15.1-mile trail run on July 6. My Garmin Forerunner 220 recorded that distance, which I trust as the route has been measured multiple ways. The vivofit decided the distance was 21.5 miles.

As with any &#34;waterproof&#34; electronics I get skeptical that maybe it will still break, but yesterday was the first ocean day, hours in the water its completely fine.I got the HRM package set, works good, I can often forget I have it on (I am a lady though so its no real different to the bra strap feeling when I wear it all the time,  Never slides down at the gym.  I origionally wore it constantly to bed and everything but your skin sweats under it and stays and it got itchy so I take it off at night now.  Havent used it in the water sine I swim for fun not training, but I can imagine that although the piece is waterproof the elastic based band wouldn't fair too well with constant water use, but any other way it wouldn't be comfortable on your skin all the time.  Many people complain about how it hooks but I don't see the problem.  Its helpful at the gym not to have to hold the treadmill's HRM which throws off my running momentum taking away my arms, and its good to keep me aware of my anxiety and familiarize myself with what's normal for my heart, while its consumer grade so not recommended as reliable if you have a preexisting problem, I know that if something is going wrong heart-wise i'll have early notice, and while i'm still young heart disease is in the family, so good to keep watch early.My only complaint is, I go the purple band so it wouldn't look to masculine on my wrist.  but in less than a month ownership a dark collection of wear has started around ridges of the band.  Makes me wish I got black but i'm still happy I got the purple since its a lovely color!Definitely recommend it!Pros: waterproof, very long battery life compared to competition, not too clunky or masculine looking, came already paired to the HRM I got with it (saved many confusing steps usually associated with pairing).Cons: Quirks when syncing (please let me know if none of you have had small troubles because if its the case that its my computer its not a quirk, either way its easy to work through just have to sync it a few more times for it to actually connect.  There's no backlight so setting it to sleep mode you have to find a light to see the screen, but I personally prefer the battery life to the light, I just know its a common complaint from people.",5,26.06.2014,"I love it, good first attempt into the life tracker feild",Garmin Vivofit Fitness Band - Teal Bundle,169.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41AvI4o2GFL._SY300_.jpg,Garmin,,6392,wear work shower water,www.amazon.com/gp/profile/A1TFSOEG7N2TTP,0.064641623,0.457838922,643

832,A1VYMMA4IRPWQQ,B00HFPOV26,Scott,1403481600,"I was going back and forth on this. Vivofit, FitBit, Fuelband, Samsung. And those are just some of the options. I read reviews, read articles, and talked to friends. I was so undecided on where to spend my money. I didn&#8217;t want to buy a device and then suffer buyers&#8217; remorse. In the end, the data led me to the Garmin Vivofit.Let me start with what it doesn&#8217;t have. It doesn&#8217;t have an altimeter. All steps are not created equal, and if you do a LOT of stairs or hill running, this may not be your device. I live in Illinois. What we call hills other&#8217;s squint at while trying to find the incline. I walk up the stairs at work, but that equates to MAYBE 100 steps a day. So, not concerned.It&#8217;s not a GPS. The Garmin name may make you think it will have this, but it does not. It works like its competition &#8211; if you need to GPS your runs, use a fitness app on your smart phone, such as MapMyWalk or MapMyRun (both of which will communicate with MyFitnessPal, which the Vivofit speaks to very nicely). Or you should be looking at a GPS watch for your workouts.This device is a movement tracker. And more. It tracks your movement all day. Every day. The band goes on your wrist, and doesn&#8217;t need to come off. The battery will last up to a year, so no need to charge it. It&#8217;s waterproof to 50 Meters, so you can swim with it, snorkel with it, and even SCUBA dive with it if you&#8217;re doing shallow dives. And you can easily shower with it, so there&#8217;s no chance you&#8217;ll forget to put it back on. It&#8217;s always on, so you can see, at a glance, how you&#8217;re doing. The screen is not backlit, but that simply gives it a longer battery life. I have not been bothered by that at all. The data it displays is very useful. Steps, steps remaining to goal, distance walked, calories burned, time, date, or (with the optional strap) heart rate.And a red bar that reminds you to get moving. After a period of inactivity (for me, it&#8217;s sitting at my desk at work&#8221; the red bar appears, and gets longer every 15 minutes until you walk around enough to turn it off. All of the health advocates recommend getting up every so often. 2 minutes every half hour. 5 minutes an hour. There are slight differences in the recommendations, but the message is consistent &#8211; keep moving! They talk about the health benefits, from circulation to blood sugar to energy, to, of course, weight management. This red bar reminds you to move. I get up and take the long way to the bathroom. I take the long way back. I use the microwave upstairs at work, just to get rid of that red bar. It&#8217;s very motivating.The device also tracks sleep. What&#8217;s missing is a sample graph that shows what a &#8220;good night&#8217;s sleep&#8221; looks like. Mine looks like I&#8217;m jogging in my sleep, but I have no idea what it means. Over time I&#8217;m able to compare myself to my prior days, and I can know when I feel good, and remember that day as a good one. But this feature is there, and it&#8217;s nice to see.And with calories, it seems to be pretty accurate. I went for a run yesterday, and wore my Vivofit along with my Polar heart rate monitor. Calories burned according to my Polar were 881, and my Vivofit guessed at 852, which is 3.4% under. Pretty darn close, if you ask me! And the Vivofit automatically updated MyFitnessPal with no interaction from me.It&#8217;s comfortable, &#8220;stylish&#8221;, and easy to read and use. It was VERY simple to set up on your smart phone (I have a Samsung Galaxy S5), and comes with a USB wireless adapter for your PC. Synching is as simple as can be. The only thing I noticed is that I have to turn off my phone&#8217;s Bluetooth if I want to synch with my PC. But once you synch, it&#8217;s synched; the information lives in the cloud, and can be accessed from any of your devices.Great device, great purchase, and no regrets!",5,23.06.2014,Great fitness tracker &#8211; zero regret,Garmin Vivofit Fitness Band - Teal Bundle,169.99,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41AvI4o2GFL._SY300_.jpg,Garmin,,6397,activity-tracking running calories,www.amazon.com/gp/profile/A1VYMMA4IRPWQQ,0.163767464,0.417938312,710

845,A743EI9BP8Z8I,B00HFPOV26,Tom Sellers,1404864000,"Been using it for about 2 weeks. I have a job that involves a fair bit of walking and it has been doing a respectable job. Then today when we were hiking I was rather surprised to look at it and see the red bar maxed out when I was about 4km into a 27km hike. As I walked along I pondered what the problem may be and realized my arms were aways parrallel to the ground because I hike with poles (lots of mountainous up and down). I remounted the Vivofit on my pack strap so it was oriented in the same direction it would be if your arm was hanging down, and it started to register the steps. In fact it logged more kilometers than the GPS was logging, but given the rough nature of the terrain and lots of steep hills, that was no surprise. I assume then that perhaps joggers and speed walkers may have similar problems, and I must not have spent enough time reading the forums where it has probably been mentioned.In addition I have not been impressed with the clasp on the strap that can easily catch on things when you are working in cramped spaces, which has resulted in my having to bind it with electrical tape so I do not lose it completely. I would appear they need to do some engineering on the band: 1st they need to redesign the clasp, and 2nd, it would help if you could swivel the head of the unit so the sensor would not get confused as to which way is up. For those two issues, I removed the same number of stars.At the moment I seem to enjoy the sleep sensor the most. Although I have no idea what good it can do me, it's interesting to see every day how restless your previous night's sleep was. The calorie counter seems almost useless, and the red bar seems unrealistic and more of a gimmic than anything. I get the impression that some people have the knowledge and discipline required to stay fit and healthy, and others do not, period. I cannot see how this device will give either group much of a leg-up in that regard. Other reviewers have voiced the opinion that this device will not really change your life after the novelty wears off, and I'd have to agree.
